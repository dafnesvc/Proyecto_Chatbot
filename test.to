It depends what country you are playing in. The European teams have professional leagues that pay their athletes to play. Depending how good you are you can make 15,000-20,000 Euros per season.

You're citing from that idiot that wrote the editorial on it aren't you? (from snopes I think) Reason I ask is it's not section 1021 like he tried to say (which covers shipyards and naval operations or something like that). Even in the correct subsection it's 1032(b) that was in the final bill that excludes US citizens and resident aliens. 1031 doesn't mention US citizens at all. The bill was also written in a manner where even the waiver can't apply since it only applies to 1032(a) paragraph 1 (which governs the criteria in paragraph 2).  newlinechar  newlinechar I analyzed the shit out of this bill. newlinechar  newlinechar EDIT: nvm, I believe you're talking about the signing statement.

Question: 'Why pray? What is the point of prayer when God knows the future and is already in control of everything. If we cannot change God's mind, why should we pray?' newlinechar  newlinechar Answer: For the Christian, praying is like breathing. It is easier to do it than to not do it. We pray for a variety of reasons. For one thing, prayer is a form of serving God (Luke 2:36-38) and obeying Him. We pray because God commands us to pray (Philippians 4:6-7). Prayer is exemplified for us by Christ and the early church (Mark 1:35; Acts 1:14; 2:42; 3:1; 4:23-31; 6:4; 13:1-3). If Jesus thought it was worthwhile to pray, we should also. If He needed to pray to remain in the Father’s will, how much more do we need to pray? newlinechar  newlinechar Another reason to pray is that God intends prayer to be the means of obtaining His solutions in a number of situations. We pray in preparation for major decisions (Luke 6:12-13); to overcome demonic barriers (Matthew 17:14-21); to gather workers for the spiritual harvest (Luke 10:2); to gain strength to overcome temptation (Matthew 26:41); and to obtain the means of strengthening others spiritually (Ephesians 6:18-19).  newlinechar  newlinechar We come to God with our specific requests, and we have God's promise that our prayers are not in vain, even if we do not receive specifically what we asked for (Matthew 6:6; Romans 8:26-27). He has promised that when we ask for things that are in accordance with His will, He will give us what we ask for (1 John 5:14-15). Sometimes He delays His answers according to His wisdom and for our benefit. In these situations, we are to be diligent and persistent in prayer (Matthew 7:7; Luke 18:1-8). Prayer should not be seen as our means of getting God to do our will on earth, but rather as a means of getting God's will done on earth. God’s wisdom far exceeds our own. newlinechar  newlinechar For situations in which we do not know God's will specifically, prayer is a means of discerning His will. If the Syrian woman with the demon-influenced daughter had not prayed to Christ, her daughter would not have been made whole (Mark 7:26-30). If the blind man outside Jericho had not called out to Christ, he would have remained blind (Luke 18:35-43). God has said that we often go without because we do not ask (James 4:2). In one sense, prayer is like sharing the gospel with people. We do not know who will respond to the message of the gospel until we share it. In the same way, we will never see the results of answered prayer unless we pray. newlinechar  newlinechar A lack of prayer demonstrates a lack of faith and a lack of trust in God’s Word. We pray to demonstrate our faith in God, that He will do as He has promised in His Word and bless our lives abundantly more than we could ask or hope for (Ephesians 3:20). Prayer is our primary means of seeing God work in others' lives. Because it is our means of “plugging into” God's power, it is our means of defeating Satan and his army that we are powerless to overcome by ourselves. Therefore, may God find us often before His throne, for we have a high priest in heaven who can identify with all that we go through (Hebrews 4:15-16). We have His promise that the fervent prayer of a righteous man accomplishes much (James 5:16-18). May God glorify His name in our lives as we believe in Him enough to come to Him often in prayer. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Source: http://www.gotquestions.org/why-pray.html newlinechar  newlinechar This website is great for answering any questions you might have^^ I personally use it all the time. newlinechar  newlinechar

It definitely sounds like you're trying to do too much. A turning point for me was when I learnt to 'play to your hand' and not to what you might get later. Say you've got 5 cards in your hand, have a decent 4-cost world you'd like to put down and maybe say Replicant Robots (4-cost dev). If dev. gets picked by another player but settle doesn't then you need to get that replicant robots down and sacrifice the world. On the flip side if settle gets picked you're probably best served sacrificing the Replicant Robots. newlinechar  newlinechar You're only harming yourself if you're skipping phases picked by others early on without doing anything in order to gather cards. They'll make the most of what they put down while you're trying to build up some master play in one hand that will still take 3 or 4 rounds to get down and more rounds after to get working.

I actually don't really like the bisexual label either, because it implies a similar dichotomy. I like transsexuals, crossdressers, androgyny, etcetera as well as men and women; and even then, I don't really *like* them in the same way that others do. I can recognize beauty, but I'm not as attracted to it as everyone else seems to be. I prefer the term 'panromantic' because it has a nice flowery ring to it, and takes the 'sexual' part out of it, sidestepping the whole 'bis are promiscuous' notion, while at the same time getting rid of the 'bi' part and replacing it with something more inclusive, but still not quite the whole truth, because I can't see myself in a relationship with a fat chick, a heavy duty body builder, a little person, etcetera etcetera. newlinechar  newlinechar I think the concept of sexuality as this static, binary thing is stupid. Love and let love. It really does seem to be the social paradigm that keeps us in these roles. And it really does feel like the LGBT community for the most part goes along with it, even while being different. newlinechar  newlinechar I mean, heck, I've noticed that even among the *T* people get hung up on gender and sexual preference. Um, hello, you're *changing* your physical birth sex. You *still* find it hard to entertain the notion of sex with someone outside your 'orientation'? You're outside *everyone's* orientation by not having the same gender and sex (although my explanation of this seems to confuse people)

I think you are confused, there have been very few cases of avian flu in humans, 573, of which 336 have died.  humans can not contract it unless they have direct contact with an infected bird which is highly unlikely.  however, of the people who have had it, 60% have died from it, the avian flu has never been a big scare because it isn't contagious.  however, it is a flu and can mutate.  if it ever does mutate then we can be in serious trouble.   newlinechar  newlinechar I'm not running around scared shitless of this.

Canadian soldiers dying in foreign hellholes does not give us magical powers to prevent other countries from being protectionist when it comes to trade. newlinechar  newlinechar Most of our influence came from the fact that in WWII we punched vastly above our population weight militarily. Our navy and air force were among the largest in the world despite having a tiny population. That's what earned us the respect of the Americans and Europeans, not a predilection for 'fence-sitting.' We certainly didn't sit on the fence during the first two world wars. newlinechar  newlinechar Finally, the whole 'peacekeeping' mantra has failed. The Europeans and the rest of the Western world are withdrawing from the combat zones of the third world. We aren't going to fix their problems for them, and 10 years of Afghanistan demonstrated that very well. Just look at how NATO and ISAF failed to find replacement troops in Afghanistan.

Guido said his job change in 2000 would let him work on Python 3k half time.

Haven't you heard? The Constitution is no longer valid. It's been for a long time. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;From an early stage, the [contras in Nicaragua] received decisive financial and military support from the United States government, initially supplemented by the Argentine dictatorship of the time. After U.S. support was banned by Congress, the Reagan administration tried to covertly continue contra aid. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;During the war against the Sandinista government, the contras carried out many violations of human rights. Their supporters in Miami and the White House often tried to downplay these, or countered that the Sandinista government carried out more such violations. In particular, the Reagan administration engaged in a campaign to alter public opinion on the contra which has been denoted as 'white propaganda'. newlinechar  newlinechar This is straight from Wikipedia, and just one small example that clearly shows how the US government disregards the constitution, US law, international law, and basic human rights whenever it feels like.

'In order to' does not authorize the government to do anything.

Just to complement a bit: newlinechar  newlinechar Catholics believe that God prevents the pope from falsely defining doctrine *only when he is solemnly defining doctrine*, which happens only a handful of times per century. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; I think the Pope has to explicitly state it as such, which is rarely done, rather that everything he says being automatically granted this status, so this could simply have been a non-divine personal opinion of the Pope. newlinechar  newlinechar To avoid confusion on whether he is invoking this privilege or not, there is a proper formula that goes like 'We solemnly decree and define that ... is what's cool to believe under pain of anathema'. newlinechar  newlinechar When the pope issues an order, or even proposes a theological explanation, this is not proposed to be an infallible statement.

I have a funny story out of it, though. Because my dad was effectively cut off then, and my mom had zero money to start with, they had a hard time for a few years especially with my mom in law school.

Of course, this is also the first time that anyone from his family had spoken to him since the wedding, so he was happy for that too. They had a great lunch at a super expensive New Orleans restaurant, and at the end of the meal, as my dad was leaving, my great-great-uncle shook his hand, told him he made a good choice and he was proud of him, and then handed him a check for fifty thousand dollars and told him not to tell his parents.

I wholeheartedly disagree. There are plenty of reasons to request the student solve the problem one way over another. There are about 5 or 6 different ways to come up with a 2-approximation algorithm for vertex cover. If you're currently going over primal-dual techniques, it would be perfectly reasonable for a professor to request you solve it using some primal-dual schema over some simply greedy approach, especially if the latter has already been covered.   newlinechar    newlinechar Vertex cover's just a really nice problem to work with in many contexts. There's no reason professors should miss out on the majority of them simply because they arbitrarily introduced one of them before all others.

Well, what part of town are you going to be living in?  I rent a room on the floor of a house, and I pay 600 a month and have two room mates in east van.  There are lots of great ways to find room mates, but look early so you can be picky.  I've used craigslist for lots of great opportunities.   newlinechar  newlinechar If you're on your own, 1200 for rent wouldn't be shocking, and eating out can get expensive.  You can find lots of cheap grocers though - stay away from big super stores for most things.  Save On Foods sometimes will have cheap meat, but for produce (spinnich, peppers, fruits, etc) go to smaller grocers with their stands going out onto the street.   newlinechar  newlinechar If you're used to shopping every day it will be a lot cheaper - but North America does have a big fridge culture.  
If you can, find a buddy to go with to push each other. If you can't, eat as much as you can and force yourself to go to the gym at least every other day. There is no reason that you cannot get big, if you put in the effort you will be rewarded; the question is though, do you want it badly enough?

It says 95% because sometimes something weird happens, such as the enemy suddenly getting knocked behind a wall by someone else's damage. You don't want it to say 100% and then miss, so it is 95%. But other than the occasional really weird happenstance, I have never missed a 95% shot either.

No, they're very consistent in their results, and [they do a good job of predicting success through life](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_intelligences#Human_intelligence). [The case of 'Terman's Termites' was dependent on Binet's IQ tests.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_Studies_of_Genius). The 'IQ tests are rubbish' meme seems to have come about as a progressive reaction against the [research showing that people of African descent, and in African countries, typically do badly on IQ tests](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_bell_curve). Also showed that people in right-wing states typically do badly on those tests. This was perceived as information that would be used to justify racist policies, so people said the apparatus used to get the information (IQ tests) was rubbish. It also caused a lot of people to start popularizing the old idea of ['multiple intelligences'](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_multiple_intelligences#Critical_reception). In my personal humble opinion, people seem to like this, because it's very 'everyone get's a trophy'- no matter how dumb you are, you get to call yourself 'smart' in some way. newlinechar  newlinechar But IQ tests in particular, and psychological tests in general, are pretty exhaustively tested and researched, for years. Dismissing them out of hand is just ignorant. I'm pretty appalled that people rejected research because its conclusions were offensive to their other beliefs- in my own humble opinion, it's the progressive community's version of creationism. Sacrificing empiricism for ideology. newlinechar  newlinechar *edited to add links

I once got called for a 'Server is down' issue where a dude had installed Norton on his PC, even though all our PCs had Nod32 installed on them.  Turns out Norton was firewalling a bunch of our network services. newlinechar  newlinechar The delicious cake part of this is that when I told him to get rid of Norton he went ballistic and complained to the CEO that IT was preventing him from keeping his data secure.  He worked in accounting and was worried about 'hackers stealing our financial data.'  He also wanted to be re-embarrassed for software he'd paid for out of pocket.  The CEO was almost as much of a luddite as the user, so this caused a major headache.  Fortunately, he knew enough to listen to me when it came to issues of computer security and IT policy.
I went through Texas History in 7th grade (as well as 10th and 11th)...  It was pretty historical and factual.  I never once thought about one side as 'good' or 'evil', simply as the losers and the victors.

Thanks for being so assuming and negative though, I'm sure you would have painted a much fairer picture of Texas history.

The continuation of the die roll is not optional and state based effects take place immediately (that is to say if you kill a creature in the middle of the ability, it immediately goes to the graveyard and becomes untargetable for future instances), so if riven is the only creature left in play, she is forced to target herself. newlinechar  newlinechar Rarities are EXTREMELY important. A benchmark of an experienced designer is being able to assign rarities to cards based on effect. That being said, I do concede its one of the harder things to REALLY familiarize oneself with. I've been following magic design for almost 12 years and I still struggle with it at times. newlinechar  newlinechar The biggest thing you need to remember when designing these things is, rather than trying to create entirely new effects to match flavor, try to dig up existing card abilities that would be appropriate for the card.
Not to hammer on you or anything, but the definition of beta testing is when you release a product to the public and collect their opinion on it *as well as* to fix bugs. So in a way meltinggaze is right - you are supposed to reflect this. newlinechar  newlinechar If it's a placeholder, Valve will come out and say 'oh this is a placeholder, don't worry, we'll work on it.' If it's not, then they benefit from it too - 'Oh, you don't like it? We'll find a way to fix it.' Win-win.

Unfortunately, I'm not too aware of any Deverry artwork, and google doesn't seem to be turning much up. In the books it's described a few times, but not in huge detail.  It's described as a 'striking falcon', and there's the below desciption of Cullyn's daughter's copy of the device: newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;&gt;While an ordinary Deverry craftsman would have drawn a falcon as a circle for a head on top of a pair of triangles for wings, Otho’s work was a lifelike side view, detailed to give the illusion of feathers, and yet it was only an inch tall. newlinechar  newlinechar So side view, of a falcon going for a strike, done in a realistic rather than overly stylised style.  I can't find anything specifically drawn as Deverry artwork, but googling a bit, maybe something like [this](http://marshallate.calontir.org/falcon-pattern.php).  Doing an image search for [heraldic falcon](http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=heraldic+falcon&amp;gs_sm=e&amp;gs_upl=1280l4175l0l4450l15l10l0l4l4l0l257l1512l0.9.1l14l0&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.,cf.osb&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=825&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=og&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=wi&amp;ei=4Kz_TvbUPMWP8gO41eSkAQ) also turns up a few that might be worth a look.
Hooping is SO easy. Seriously. I never thought I could even make the hoop go around more than once, but it was explained to me like this and it clicked instantly: (I have since taught other people this way and they also get it instantly.) newlinechar  newlinechar First you need a relatively heavy, large hoop. A heavy hoop will be about two pounds--I make starter hoops out of 1'', 100psi PVC piping. You can get it at the hardware store but they only sell it in amounts that will make 7-10 hoops. There's tons of stuff on Instructables for making hoops. I digress. But a light, small hoop will not be good for your first time. newlinechar  newlinechar Get your hoop. newlinechar  newlinechar Stand with your feet hip-width apart, but step forward with your left foot. (This is if you are hooping counter-clockwise, which is how my roommate and I do it. Reverse everything if you're gonna go the other way.) newlinechar  newlinechar Start hooping. Don't 'hula'. You pretty much just want to do a back-and-forth pelvic thrust. No side-to-side motion. You want the hoop to hit your body on your left hip bone and your right love-handle. newlinechar  newlinechar Try this for 20 minutes. You WILL get it. Once you get the basic hoop motion, you can start spinning in place (both directions! Very important! With the hoop AND against the hoop), and once you can spin, you can begin learning tricks, like the vortex.

My calculus exams back in University usually only required you to solve 4 problems (sometimes split into subcategories, such as problem 1.a, 1.b etc.). Each exam was 3 hour long and you couldn't use any calculators or other similar tools to help out. newlinechar  newlinechar This meant each problem usually took a few pages of handwritten calculations to solve. newlinechar  newlinechar When you are doing multiple pages of calculations, for just a single problem, a single irrelevant error can lead to a completely wrong final solution. Yet those multiple pages of calculations can still easily show the professor that you actually perfectly understood the method he was testing you on. In those cases, the teacher can be 'lenient' and give you a full or near-full grade for your answer. This is because the final solution isn't actually what he is testing you for. He is testing to see if you understand and know how to apply a certain method (or a set of methods). newlinechar  newlinechar What is considered a relevant or an irrelevant error obviously varies.
Exactly. That's why I went gay.
&gt;I refuse to believe that because it seems as if she'd be a sweetheart. newlinechar  newlinechar What do you base this on? The people that think she's a bitch met her for a small window of time. She's a human being, so she likely has a full range of human emotions. How any of you people can deign to know what this person's personality is like baffles me.
Certainly, that's a plausible hypothesis. However, there are plenty of plausible hypotheses, and we need reasons to believe they are true, not just that they are possible.

Ok, if SpaceX or Virgin were to go completely nuts and start sibsidizing things like this then it certainly would be a possibilty. I doubt that would happen though. Right now space travel, manned or unmanned is on par with building cathedrals centuries ago. It is the province of states and billionaires. When space flight is more akin in, terms of cost, to being a private pilot, then you will see private satellite networks take off. Until then most of this is staying on the drawing board. newlinechar  newlinechar On a side not, someone in another thread about this subject mentioned putting more research in ionospheric radio transmissions. Maybe the guys at CCC should look into this. Much cheaper and more feasible. Relatively.

What you're describing in controlling the environment of the baby is entirely beside the point in this case.

She may have helped them in a minor way with lotion (To prevent stretch marks) but what she has is largely attributable to circumstance rather than ability.

I don't think it's nearly as important as getting the corporate lobbies out. If you want to be a lobbyist, pursue that career. If you want to be a Senator, pursue that one.

I don't really care about the whys or wherefores. I'm actually pretty sure this exact same article was posted here about a month ago and we had this same discussion. My main problem is that it's talked about at all - whether it's lying or boasting is irrelevant, the sheer fact that it's spoken about as a factor reinforces every worry a man could ever have about it. newlinechar  newlinechar The number of times I've overheard women remarking on cock size when they think they aren't to be overheard is staggering, and what's more worrying is that none of them know a fucking thing, but fail to realise it. From a partner exaggerating the size of his penis so she now thinks all five-inchers are over eight, to her fucking an eight-inch guy and thinking that's what does it for her when she fails to notice (because she can't see between her legs) that she only actually takes the first four inches. But still we're told to our faces 'it doesn't matter' and 'it's what you do with it that counts'. But then you overhear discussion that leads you to wonder otherwise. newlinechar  newlinechar I dunno, I know guys can talk on trashy subjects too but I've never been part of one of those conversations, as I'm sure many women have never discussed a guy's cock size. But unfortunately all it takes is one incident to ignite that little spark of insecurity. newlinechar  newlinechar The worst thing is that you can look up every statistic and measure it to the millimetre, and even if you know you are factually significantly above average, as I am, it does nothing to assuage that anxiety about it. It's a niggle that won't fuck off, regardless of your size. That's the most fucked-up part.

&gt; But don't you understand? I couldn't get gear or attunements because I couldn't get into a guild that could kill bosses because I couldn't get gear or attunements because I couldn't get into a guild that could kill bosses.... newlinechar  newlinechar I understand that, but what I'm saying is that the attunements were much less relevant than the gear and experience. Even without attunements, it's not like successful guilds would suddenly welcome everyone with open arms. You still need to be geared for the content or you're holding the raid back... and at that time, the only way to get geared was by completing the prior content (which covers attunement). newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; This is why attunements were removed and the previous tier's gear is made more accessible immediately after new content is released, because the WoW dev team gets what so many of the game's players are unwilling to. newlinechar  newlinechar I understand the concept and I think it's a good one. I just think attunements are unfairly blamed for holding people back when more often than not, they were just the most visible. Even throughout WotLK, many PuGs required the dungeon completion achievement *for the very dungeon the group was clearing*. That's even dumber than attunement.  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Also, you didn't see me perform then, so it's unfair to say I personally would need to be carried. newlinechar  newlinechar I don't mean any personal offense, but any guild geared in S2 PvP gear without gear past Moroes would not be able to kill bosses in SSC or TK... even if they were all excellent players.

I don't really think this is a well thought-out article. newlinechar  newlinechar I mean, what he's essentially saying is that since **he** assumed that the form of the grid implied a supremely non-linear fashion that clearly that must be the**sole** reason it was constructed as such. newlinechar  newlinechar But that's still a lot.  There are still quite a few different ways to level up each character which constitute a range of choices for a player.  And even if it didn't, did you even ask Aleriya was his reason was for choosing the Sphere Grid?  It might not have even had to do with linearity, but this article only (poorly) addresses that one aspect. newlinechar  newlinechar In reality, I think they just made it that way so it wouldn't take up as much space.

There are not that many people going hungry.  That is a misconception.  It is like saying everyone in North America is rich, which is something many Tanzanians believe.   newlinechar  newlinechar If a Tanzanian cannot afford to buy food, they will farm, try and find work (there are day laborers), or seek assistance.  One of the remnants of socialism is that Tanzanians take great care of each other.  There are very few street people, they are usually taken in by a family member.  Family is very loosely defined there, so there are generally many family members who are willing to help.  Though that help may be meager, it keeps many people housed and fed. newlinechar  newlinechar Lastly, it is very cheap to eat there.  The main dish is ugali, which is a stiff porridge made from coarse corn flour, and beans. You could buy a kilo of each for around a dollar.  So even if you only make a dollar a day, you can still eat.  When certain things are in season, you can get an orange for a few pennies.  Or, you can sit under a mango tree, wait for the breeze to blow, and eat a mango that just fell straight from the tree.  No charge.

I dont have children,and I'vey  never been married, yet I would never come between a man and his daughter, or have a man choose me over his daughter.

I think ODB is more of a moonshine lady. 
I agree.  From a personal perspective, the rational response is to take steps to minimize harm to yourself and others around you.  Of course, this can at times conflict with the desire to bring long-term massive societal change which maximizes freedom and safety for groups which are discriminated against.  I imagine that most of the posters who disagree with you probably are thinking more about the second goal than the first.   newlinechar  newlinechar I've never directly experienced the issues many male redditors complain about.  (Of course, that may be because almost everyone around me has always been super-nice and above-average).  Nonetheless, reading about them absolutely terrifies me because I don't see any way to protect myself.   newlinechar  newlinechar Psychologically, the only way to avoid having that impact me was to say, my chances of being falsely accused are very low given my behavior, so I'll just have to put it in the category of things like being killed a falling space station toilet seat that are too unlikely to worry about.  If a bunch of people around me decide to frame me for anything, I'm probably screwed. newlinechar  newlinechar When it comes to adjusting your outward personality to appear better in others' eyes, I'm trying to do the same when it comes to gaming and such.   newlinechar  newlinechar (My apologies in advance if I'm discounting your experiences by comparing my own to them.  They are significant to me, even if far, far less important on an absolute level.)   newlinechar  newlinechar If you say, 'no, I don't like watching sports, I like playing games and watching professional Starcraft', you're placing yourself in the category of white nerdy shut-in (probably referred to in the SRS group of subreddits as neckbeard).  People regard you badly because of that.  Just spending time lots of reading leads to picking up word choices, patterns, and ways of speaking which stand out, and identify you in a way which can be negative to those around you.  
The pay check usually isn't representative of the amount of work you put in, so that's somewhat irrelevant. Ex) You may bill for a procedure that costs $2000, the insurance company will send you a check for $100. This actually happens!
Numbers aren't everything. As someone mentioned earlier in this thread, Iraq had the third biggest army in the world before the first Gulf War and their equipment had not suffered 20 years of neglect. The United States made short work of their army. North Korea may have lots of manpower but their equipment is rubbish and in today's warfare, that's what counts.  
that would take a lot of field goals

If an animal is given a happy life, and killed with one shot to the head leading to instant and painless death, while it may not be what you want for yourself, it is a much more humane way to raise animals is dispatch with them to make meat. newlinechar  newlinechar In a perfect world we'd all get our ways, but there are many people who eat meat and they will not reverse course. It seems obvious that the less animals that have to suffer in torturous slaughterhouses, and are instead treated with respect, and killed like Lenny in Of Mice and Men the better. newlinechar  newlinechar It's still dying, but imagine dying in your own filth vs surrounded by love and family. It's not a clean or equal comparison, but as long as people eat meat, why not support and even be enthusiastic that people are really starting to shift overall to wanting humane production of it.

I think the point we have to consider is 'how do you control the masses, so that they do what you want?'. This problem is well defined since hundreds of thousands of years, and due to the nature of humans, we know that fear works well, and reward as well.  newlinechar  newlinechar Mind you, this problem is a very important one in creating societies. Societies thrive because they have a common goal against a challenge. Having a group of people acting in unison to conquer the challenge is fundamental. Religion is just an aggregating beacon so that people can act cohesively to face the challenge, and it aggregates and control through fear and reward. newlinechar  newlinechar Communism is an economic doctrine, and a societal structure. There are similarities to a religion, although you may say the same with capitalism and the current economic system. Nevertheless, from my understanding of communism, it scales up really badly. The current system is not perfect, but it seems to scale up fairly well. Those who tried to implement communism had to fight because they had to fight against the human nature, which is hardly communist, and to structure the society around it, they had to use fear and reward. newlinechar  newlinechar This is just my feeling from a rather limited knowledge. I am mostly ignorant on these topics and I am probably wrong. Please correct me if I am. newlinechar

The money that you put into Roth IRAs can be withdrawn penalty-free, whereas withdrawing from a 401k carries a steep penalty. This effectively makes the Roth a backup savings account / emergency fund, and that's the primary reason people use them over 401ks. As doubleknot said, if you're not using a Roth, then there's not nearly as much of a reason to use an IRA over a 401k.

In the laning phase it hurts you more than it helps you. You used it on creeps when it was level 1 / 2 and it did not net you more last hits just made it harder for you to properly time your own attacks.

Scientific notation is when you use 1 digit to the left of the decimal place, then the decimal digits, then multiply it by 10^x. It's mainly used in science, as numbers tend to get very big. you could write 1892300000, or 1.8923 x 10^9. It also makes dividing/multiplying large numbers easier, as you can just add/subtract exponents of 10.

I feel compelled to point out that this advice is not entirely accurate. Because you two are not married, and depending on the state, she will likely automatically have full and total custody of the baby when it is born. This means that she can tell you to fuck off until a judge signs off on a custody order. It can take months to get a court date, and leaving the state in the mean time could make things tricky. That is why it's important to start the legal process right now. It's important for fathers to have the opportunity to bond with the baby from the beginning. I just wanted to clarify. Don't assume you have any rights until you have an official court order. Not being married makes a huge difference in most states.

I did a bunch of casting of Company of Heroes over on GameReplays.org 2 years ago.  One of the things I learned (aside from studying up on teams and their strategies) was to 'throw' questions to people that were pros.  Ask 'why' questions, like 'Ezreal has 20 less CS than Corki bot lane, why do you think that's happening'.  Take your observations about the game and turn them into lead in questions for the experts.  That can get people unstuck if they are quiet, and naturally leads the conversation along into a give and take.   newlinechar  newlinechar Generally with 2 people, one is the technical person, and one is color commentary.

It is a bit fiddly to remove all air bubbles and get the siphon working, but well worth it for the cost savings. newlinechar  newlinechar All up, back in 2009, I spent around $150 on the CIS system. Given the amount of ink remaining when I threw it out a year ago (new printer), I probably saved upwards of $500. newlinechar  newlinechar That said, I haven't bothered to replace it. I wasn't printing frequently enough for the ink to refill continuously and the ink lines seemed to need priming (somewhat time consuming, messy process) every time I wan't to print something. I still effectively used it as a set of refillable cartridges, manually pushing ink through the pipes to refill the cartridges as they depleted.

I think it's good that 4chan is around, because they are kind of the free-speech canary in the coal mine. As long as they're still up, the rest of us are kind of safer by default.  newlinechar  newlinechar I don't post there either because I think it would not be an environment I'd enjoy, though. I don't know a lot about it, though I did read a bunch of a comment thread here awhile back when a 4chan admin posted an IAMA. It was kind of interesting. newlinechar  newlinechar One of the biggest problems reddit has is that a casual passerby will just see the default subreddits, which are the most popular ones, and not realize the immense expanse that lies beneath all of that. There are over 3000 subreddits and only 20 are defaulted to the front page for those who don't have accounts. newlinechar  newlinechar One of the top subreddits, r/askscience, wound up so popular that they were on the default front page, and the mods all unanimously requested that they be removed, because they don't want to deal with a lot of foolishness, they want the entire discussion to be serious. That's a good example of what is wrong with the reddit programming, as r/askscience is an interesting and helpful subreddit run by serious, adult people who are not there to go around starting fights by insulting each other, which is refreshing. I'm not saying I know how to fix any of this, but there does seem to be a bit of a 'scum rises to the top' problem. Maybe it's better that way, I don't know. But I do feel like reddit gets a worse name than it deserves, because of this design.  newlinechar  newlinechar I wish that reddit would include in its registration formula some way to get this across to people a little more strongly. A subreddit search engine built right into it would be great. It took me awhile to realize what was going on, how it all worked. The top 20 subreddits are often fairly facile and often ridden with hostility. That isn't what I'm looking for on the Internet. It took me awhile to start thinking about just experimenting...typing in /r/this and /r/that, just to see if there was anybody there.  newlinechar  newlinechar Also I found at least one site on the web awhile back that indexed and searched the subreddits. You could likely track that down without much trouble.

Much of that can be remedied through transparency.  Open source code would allow many more eyes to preen for security vulnerabilities which could then be more quickly addressed.  It may sound like a bad idea at first to have more public access to it, but it works exceedingly well in practice.  Consider, for example, that Linux accounts for approximately 70% of all web servers. newlinechar  newlinechar Open source is the king of infrastructure.  It yields faster development cycles because of tighter integration since coders are better able to understand how to properly interface their programs.  Most importantly, it allows for more secure systems from the bottom up. newlinechar  newlinechar As for mechanical vote accuracy - hanging chads.

Generally, though, what makes the greatest conductors great is not just this. A conductor needs to show the beat, but also interpret the piece for the musicians. newlinechar  newlinechar An orchestra can have 100 musicians. Individually, each may be a master, but there must be one interpretation of the piece, not 100, and that is how the conductor operates. newlinechar  newlinechar In the way s/he moves, the conductor suggests how the piece should be played, conveying a lot of information in hand gestures. newlinechar  newlinechar Look at [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=422-yb8TXj8) video. The top comment once said 'Music by the New York Philharmonic, interpretive dance by Leonard Bernstein.' newlinechar  newlinechar It's true, in a sense, but by doing all those things, he conveys to the orchestra how the piece is supposed to sound, and how his interpretation is to differ from others'.

I was going more in the context of putting discrimination and a religious message in the same page.

Teachers however are not permitted to pray in public institutions, which is a whole different story.) newlinechar  newlinechar **I apologize if my wording seemed confusing.

But, I would not like to confuse a religious message with the discriminatory ways of this said Teacher.** *Excuse my rant.*

Hey look, this guy has found a way to feel superior to both the OP and me! You, too, are a condescending elitist hipster douche bag (I spelled it out for you this time). Am I being needlessly hostile? Probably. This is the internet, enjoy your stay. newlinechar  newlinechar Anyway, allow me to explain my position more thoroughly. You (and Al_X_Gore) cannot assume, based on the limited information that the OP has provided, that he has not seen the films listed by Al_X_Gore. What if he has seen all of the listed films, and Pulp Fiction is *still* his favorite movie? The flawed premise you and Al_X_Gore seem to go by is that Pulp Fiction is somehow an inherently inferior film, and the OP has simply not experienced *truly good* films. This is the exact sentiment that the OP is talking about when he made his post. You and Al_X_Gore have an elitist superiority complex (which I call condescending elitist hipster douche bag syndrome) based on information that has not been provided and is only assumed. newlinechar  newlinechar Now, your final argument, that Al_X_Gore's list of movies are popular and critically acclaimed among 'cinephiles', is completely irrelevant. A favorite movie is a personal, *opinion based* value judgement, and can and often is based off of more than just the merit of a movie's story and aesthetics (which is what a critic may look at). A favorite movie may be a favorite because of the memories that the movie instills in the individual viewer. Maybe he, too, saw it when he was 14, and it is his favorite movie because when he watches it it makes him feel young again. Maybe it reminds him of the thrill of watching movies. newlinechar  newlinechar Keep in mind that the OP did not say that Pulp Fiction is *the best* movie, the most innovative, or the most critically acclaimed movie. Asking what *the best* movie is is very different from asking for a *favorite* movie. This distinction is very important to remember. newlinechar  newlinechar For the record, I don't think that Pulp Fiction is that good of a movie and I think that Tarantino is overrated. And I enjoyed some of the movies on Al_X_Gore's list. But these are my opinions, and I am not going to judge others based entirely on what they list as their favorite movie.

It's a pretty complicated thing though.

&gt; Thanks for your response. I feel like I'm trying to subscribe to the 120 minus your age in bonds. Maybe it should be more like 100. newlinechar  newlinechar Another rule of thumb to couple with that is Ben Graham's: never have less than 25% bonds (or 25% stocks, for that matter) - under 25% either and you start to lose diversification benefits rapidly. It's too late on New Year's Eve for me to scramble around looking for 'em before I head out, but I have some links somewhere that illustrate this - basically, it gets to the point where your risks go up dramatically but expected returns barely budge upward at all after you pass ~75% equities. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; I agree that the portfolio is busy but I feel like sectors help to diversify which is why I'm confused you don't have any weighting on sectors? I guess by holding each of the caps it would be helpful to just hold the market in terms of ease. newlinechar  newlinechar I have some of *all* of those sectors - just don't tilt actively toward any one of them in particular. By definition, the market portfolio *is* the most diversified - you start to remove diversification as you tilt away from it. From what I can tell, it looks like you also somewhat randomly picked the sector funds that Vanguard has Investor Class mutual fund shares of - believe me, I get the temptation: as it happens, those sectors did well this past decade, and it is tempting to invest in the rear view ;) newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; I'll definitely take into consideration what you and wavegeekman said. I agree that holding too heavily positions within the us market is risky. I think I'll at least increase my intl exposure to 30%. The concerns I have with international is the expenses charged seem to be higher that most other funds. newlinechar  newlinechar You are right to be concerned with expenses, but both Vanguard Total Stock and Vanguard Total International have such low expenses compared to most any other fund it is really just about nickles and dimes at that point. The question you have to ask yourself is: why would you put over 2/3 of your eggs in one basket? Moreover, your job is tied to the US economy, and many of your non-investment assets are or will be as well (e.g. a house). This is definitely something that is hotly debated, and I can't say I have the 'right' answer, but I think the starting point should be the market portfolio, which is about 40/60 US/international - if you want to tilt that to the point where it is 70/30 I think you just need to sort out for yourself the reasons why, and assess whether they are good ones that will hold up over decades (or whether there is a significant risk of, for instance, a Japan-like scenario!). Personally, I think anything beyond a 60/40 is tempting fate, and prefer something in the 40/60 (market weights) to 50/50 (simple and slightly US-tilted).
It's ok; it wasn't funny anyway.

&gt; How safe is this 'soft disclosure'? newlinechar  newlinechar It's hard to say and I wouldn't want to steer you wrong. In the past tax advisors commonly suggested taking this approach. Recently the IRS has been taking more of an interest in these cases, but for the most part they do go after the big fish first.  newlinechar  newlinechar Having multiple passports doesn't buy you time per se, but it gives you the doomsday option of severing ties with the USA in the event that the IRS takes a position with you that you find unacceptable. As your intention was not fraudulent, it's very likely they would squander limited goodwill on extradition. newlinechar  newlinechar Whether any of this matters depends on the amounts at stake. newlinechar  newlinechar If you owe nothing (haven't earned more than ~$90k/year from work, and no significant investment income) then it's just failure-to-file and I believe the penalty is on the order of a couple hundred bucks a year. You could start filing and know the maximum they might get you for. Or you could come forward and explain your situation and they might let you off, especially in that situation. newlinechar  newlinechar If, on the other hand, you do owe more than a trivial amount of money, then you should probably talk to a tax professional. newlinechar  newlinechar In the long term, they are getting stricter every year so it's better to deal with it now than in the future. newlinechar  newlinechar http://www.irs.gov/businesses/small/article/0,,id=122721,00.html

Extremely relevant. Think of it like this: prior to the universe's definite existence, we can assume that the fundamental properties of physics that we know about (gravity, strong nuclear, etc) didn't exist due to the extreme nature of the location our universe was contained in. Mathematically, this is sound. The only way to understand the physical nature of the universe in such an extreme situation is through quantum science. Many quantum events do not obey causality and are, therefore, causeless. It is possible that the Big Bang was itself causeless, merely a quantum fluke that happened to produce the universe. newlinechar  newlinechar No, I don't know if I'm completely right. I could be, but more likely I'm not. I'm just one person. I recommend looking up studies and papers on the subject. I'm sure you may be able to find some reputable scientific journals that talk about the matter. Just try Google!

&gt;total debt reported by the treasury is the only true measure of what we owe. It went up every year. newlinechar  newlinechar This statement defies sanity when it is applied to debt owed to self, as it does here.  newlinechar  newlinechar As of right now, today, Dec 31 2011, I, otherwiseyep, have roughly ~$20,000 in my primary everyday checking account. If tomorrow, I transfer that into an escrow account held in my name, and lend myself $20,000 of my own money, with interest and principal payable to me, has my total net worth changed? No. Has my credit-worthiness or ability to re-pay changed? No. Has my real purchasing-power changed? No. **Has my actual, genuine, cash-basis (or any other measure) net-worth changed? Not one penny.** newlinechar  newlinechar The only difference between today and tomorrow is that I wrote a piece of paper that says I owe myself my own money. That has not affected my real purchasing power nor ability to repay other debt one iota.  newlinechar  newlinechar Craig Steiner completely (maybe willfully) misunderstands or misrepresents this.  newlinechar  newlinechar It is not wrong to count future SS obligations against the total debt, but it *is* wrong to move the goalposts according to unadjusted SS revenues. The government accounting rules say that increased SS revenues equal increased SS obligations, but those are purely accounting rules: SS is a general obligation paid out of the general fund, regardless of whether the gov't calls it 'Social Security' money (e.g., you pay your mortgage and buy groceries with whatever money is in your bank account, you don't starve just because all your money is in the 'videogame account').  newlinechar  newlinechar Your assessment: newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; (real debt is) a simple equation: what you borrow - what you pay down. newlinechar  newlinechar Works only insofar as you are not lending to yourself.  newlinechar  newlinechar Finance and accounting =/= economics. Writing down a number on a piece of paper does not alter reality. You or I or anyone could do what the government does in this sense: you could deposit every penny you earn into an account that lends money to the account that you buy groceries and pay the mortgage with, and declare yourself to have zero cash but instead to have a debt against your future self. Every dollar you earn would *increase your debt* to your future self, since, in this accounting scheme, you never earn money, you just borrow it from yourself.  newlinechar  newlinechar You could accrue a billion or a trillion or a quadrillion dollars in personal net worth, but your accounting would only ever show it as increasing debt under this scheme. You could never ever possibly pay it off, and the richer you got, the poorer your balance sheet would show you to be. But this is just a fiction of accounting, since you are both the debtor and creditor.  newlinechar  newlinechar The reason this is confusing is because normal people don't lend themselves money, but the government does. The government records any money paid as SS taxes as 'debt' owed to itself. The more money it collects, the more 'debt' it accrues.  newlinechar  newlinechar This is purely a fiction of accounting: by this measure, the government would accrue less (accounting) debt by not collecting any SS taxes, but it would still have the same obligations, just less money with which to pay them.  newlinechar  newlinechar The Treasury does not decide what the obligations of the US gov't are, the Legislature does, ratified by the President.

It's offensive because a majority of there are more posts about mocking religion than there are posts actually talking about atheism. A good example of this is the recent comic which compares Prometheus to Jesus. It doesn't really belong here because all it does is make fun of Catholicism/Christianity. Sometimes, there is good content but that happens quite rarely now. I think the chances of the UAE blocking /r/atheism would have been much lower if majority of the posts didn't simply mock religion (I use this term loosely as religion for /atheism since it's mocking seems to be limited to the Abrahamic religions). newlinechar  newlinechar EDIT: added a few words that were missing.
Communities don't exist in a vacuum, and many of us are not opposed to travel.  This is what we do ... attempt support with the oppressed, and accommodate the dispossessed, wherever feasible.  It stands to reason we'll continue to do so whatever the circumstances.  I can no more predict isolated methods used than I can where and when such needs will arise.  Could be anything from helping people with unmet needs, protesting, boycotting enterprises, assisting relocation, direct confrontation ... anything, really.  Hateful fuckers tend to earn reciprocity; often alleviating themselves of supporters in the process.

I'm torn on that one... You could argue they just took an existing character and just changed one thing. newlinechar  newlinechar But then you think back and you see Data having conversations with Einstein and you wonder, is he really having a conversation with an Einstein brain simulated in a computer, or just the computer's approximation of what the computer thinks einstein would act like, and if you really wanted to, you could break it, like by asking him what his favorite color is, and explain why, or something like that. newlinechar  newlinechar No matter what, one rule seems to be necessary for much of ST to hold up, and that is True Human level AI doesn't exist yet, or else the computer wouldn't be such a dumbass sometimes, and Data wouldn't be so clunky. newlinechar  newlinechar We could split hairs a bit finer: Perhaps garden variety Human Level AI has been invented, but Human Emotions is a separate thing and a harder problem. That is all the holodeck characters (Einstein, Moriarity) have a true functioning simulated non-emotion brain, augmented by a clunk hueristic emotional AI. So you could engage Einstein in conversations about science and everything would work fine, but as soon as you asked him about his larger aspirations or views on philosophy or what he desired to do right now in the context of his existence, he's have to fall back on canned answers recorded from the original Einstein. Likewise Moriarity made a suitable opponent in a very technical game of Hide-the-holodeck, but could only ever love one woman. newlinechar  newlinechar In light of this, the Doc is very different creature. He wants to expand himself and fall in love and learn opera and whatever the hell. He doesn't want to do them in service of becoming more like a human, but he WANTS to do them, like he really is a human. If this type of human mimicry was possible so easily, why wasn't it achieved with data, whom only copies human because he has one goal, to be more human, and if keeping a cat gets him closer to that goal, then he'll do it.

I don't think it even took me two hours. All I did was set it up so I was making big money through lots of exports, then I just flooded the entire map with apartment buildings and farms while having immigration on open. They fill up very quickly. I don't know what 'silver spoon' is, or anything about the game really, but I do plan to play it again (it was funny and I like city games). I don't remember anything about difficulty levels so I probably just did it on whatever the default setting was.  newlinechar  newlinechar I paid attention at the start to get a solid economy going, then once I thought it was sustainable enough I just pumped out apartments all over the entire map. I'm assuming it wouldn't have ended well since I built basically no infrastructure after the initial setup, but I got 1000 citizens very quickly by just putting it on fast forward and watching people move in. I made tons of farms to attract farmers because it seemed like one of the best cheap options to employ multiple people.

That's honestly a personal opinion that people will give you different answers to.  For me, MM is better than Ocarina.  Ocarina had a solid adventure, but MM had a solid overall *world*.  The characters were fleshed out, interesting, and getting involved in their side quest stories was the highlight of the game.  Also the overworld is more compact than OoT, but is filled with a lot more secrets, so it doesn't feel like as much wasted space as Hyrule Field from OoT. newlinechar  newlinechar If you play MM (which, of course, I highly recommend) don't just blow through the main quest.

I remember in an interview with Wenger one year ago said that when Song retrieved the ball he would slow down the game because he had to breathe right again, and was slow with looking for the past, but now he has improved and he manages to help the game flow. But now when i see Ramsey play and when he has the ball, I can't help keep being reminded by  what Wenger said about players slowing down the play of the game, whto him en Ramsey is on the ball - there are very good through ball passes that is available to him which could release Robin if he didn't dwell on the ball and just do a one touch pass. But the Problem is that Ramsey can't see those passes that we can on the stands or on TV.

so if Chaox is on a smurf and he's last pick, you expect him to play support and carry the team, even though you and the 3 others are making the worst calls ever?

If I don't feel like putting up with bullshit, I instalock heimerdinger say mid or feed and proceed to carry them because I KNOW I'm better than 1500 players.

Sarcasm and text don't get along very well
It has a _very_ specific meaning, and I am applying it here quite intentionally. You are the product of a misogynistic culture, a culture that belittles and suppresses women and has done so for generations.  While this has markedly improved over the past hundred years, it still has its influences on society; the overt misogyny of the past is fading, but its more subtle legacy remains, in the belittlement of womens' concerns, the discounting of their opinions, in the implication that they are only worth as much as their beauty, that being smart is an unappealing trait in a woman and being forceful even more so, that the woman shares the blame if she is raped, and on, and on, and on. newlinechar  newlinechar As I explained elsewhere, like after the post where you said to me that you are 'trying to start to see the problem', your heedlessness of the underlying issues here, your quick leap without the facts to 'Ms. Watson is over-reacting', and so on....they are at least partially manifestations of this latent bias.  'Watson must be over-reacting because women are irrational and overly sensitive', the bias tells you....and without questioning the facts, without knowing what set this whole thing off in the first place, you just bought into the 'Watson is being hysterical' narrative.  You immediately were skeptical that she had received death threats and rape fantasies and all kinds of nastiness in response to her suggestion that getting hit on by a stranger alone in an elevator at four in the morning might be suboptimal.  You fired off all kinds of references to her 'chosen victimhood' as if she were running around hand to forehead lamenting the incident as an attack against her, when she absolutely did not. newlinechar  newlinechar You are most definitely 'acting the misogynist' here, and there's no reason I should not call you on it. Notice that I pointed out that I believe you are acting the part unintentionally and that you have no idea you are reenforcing the anti-female bias in the culture.  Your intentions are good, you are just blind to the more subtle biases that are influencing your actions. newlinechar  newlinechar (Edit for clarity)

Just speak your mind. newlinechar  newlinechar And to answer your question: There's a complicated answer for such a simple question, but I'll try to make it simple. God exists outside the universe as well as inside the universe. It's like if you drew a circle in the middle of a piece of paper. The circle represents the universe; the paper represents God, both inside and outside the universe. newlinechar  newlinechar At least that's supposed to be the idea.  newlinechar  newlinechar Before you get all 'the universe is infinite' or whatever, keep in mind that God is infinite too. And it is possible for one infinite to be bigger than another. To quote Neil deGrasse Tyson in his recent AmA: newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Q: Hey Neil, can you somehow try to to make it a little easier to grasp the concept of infinity. best wishes from Germany! newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;A: No. The human mind, forged on the plains of Africa in search of food, sex, and shelter, is helpless in the face of infinity. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Therein is the barrier to learning calculus for most people -- where infinities pop up often. The best you can do is simply grow accustomed to the concept. Which is not the same as understanding it. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;And when you are ready, consider that some infinities are larger than others. For example, there are more fractions than there are counting numbers, yet they are both infinite. Just a thought to delay your sleep this evening. newlinechar  newlinechar I know he wasn't referencing God with his explanation of infinity, but if it's true, it's true.

Actually this is the DesMoines Register poll -- which DOES include independents, to wit: newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;The Iowa Poll, conducted Dec. 27-30 for The Des Moines Register by Selzer &amp; Co. of Des Moines, is based on interviews with 2,527 registered Republican and independent voters in Iowa ages 18 or older, of which 602 said they would definitely or probably participate in the January 2012 Republican caucus. newlinechar  newlinechar Now that's obviously an oversampling (typical ACTUAL attendance is around 1-2% of the electorate, double that to be maybe 5% to account for the fact that the roster of callers is 'better than average' in terms of actual attendance) in terms of people expressing intentions which they will not carry out -- out of the 600 who *claim* they will caucus, probably about ~125-150 will *actually* attend, and the remaining ~450-500 won't. newlinechar  newlinechar That said, the DR poll has actually been pretty darned accurate in the past (well, at least more accurate than other polls, and especially this close to the caucus). newlinechar  newlinechar I myself had doubts about the Santorum thing -- but he seems to have pulled the 'Ignorant Old Woman' demographic away from Gingrich -- having spoken to a few in the midwest here, now that the media has been pushing Santurm, the old women are thinking: *'He seems like a nice young guy who likes babies and will protect us from those scary Iranian A-rab terrywrists'* (and, alas, that's about as much deep-thinking as that demographic ever does). newlinechar  newlinechar Pray for a blizzard (or ice storm, or even really cold weather) and Santorum will get zip, because the old ladies will stay home -- if the weather is really nice, relatively warm &amp; dry (and BTW that's what the current forecast is) he'll probably be a contender as the old biddies will show up then.

Sweden works because its an area the size of a State. The Constitution was set up to let States make their own programs because it wouldn't make sense for one central government to dictate social policies in 50 small countries. Its how the US ended up with the Defense of Marriage Act that essentially bans gay marriage across the entire country while spitting in the face of States that want to legalize gay marriage. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;I think the founding fathers would've wanted the US population to be creative in continuing the development of a country which they wanted to be the greatest on earth. newlinechar  newlinechar This is why we have Amendments.

&gt;I assumed that if your family had 250 million some that you would have a decent chunk of change, maybe 5 million or so. newlinechar  newlinechar There are two main types of assets, liquid and hard.  newlinechar  newlinechar A liquid asset is something like money. It's immediate, its value won't rise or diminish much between the point in which you bought/exchanged for it and when you sell/exchange it, and it doesn't really matter all that much what the market looks like because it's so low-risk that it's not worth speculating on.  newlinechar  newlinechar A hard asset is something that you invest in for the long haul, like a house or oil. Its value will hopefully rise dramatically, but only over the course of many months/years. You want to make *sure* the value is at its peak when you sell a hard asset because otherwise you're kicking a ball into the stands and yelling 'goal!' newlinechar  newlinechar Coming from a similar background and similar numbers as OP, you don't want liquid assets. If you go back even four decades ago, money had something like five times the purchasing power that it has today. That means that our families would effectively have $50.000.000 rather than $250.000.000. There's a world of difference between those two numbers, so instead of keeping your wealth in something which is guaranteed to tank in value you instead invest the vast majority in hard assets, turning that $250.000.000 into $500.000.000 down the line (even if that $500.000.000 has the same buying power). newlinechar  newlinechar She doesn't seem to like giving specific numbers, but for reference sake my trust fund is only in the upper six digit range. That seems like a lot, but in reality it's going to be enough to emigrate, buy a house, furnish it, and set up a nestegg. My family's liquid assets are likely somewhere in the low eight digit range, even if our net worth (the combined value of all assets) is approaching the mid nines. All of that money is locked down with no hope of ever touching it unless I sell everything you don't want to sell off when I get control over that kind of stuff, and doing so is basically fucking over every subsequent generation for a bit of momentary comfort.  newlinechar  newlinechar

I was really disappointed to see a comic like that reach the top of the thread. And I like to think that humanity is more good than bad. This coupled with the fact that at the time of the post, not a single person explained why rape-jokes are bad in a non 'logical-fallacy' kind of way such as ad-hominem was what motivated to make this throw-away. newlinechar  newlinechar The first post was mostly an experiment to see if Reddit would upvote a clear and well articulated post defending the - or so it appears - quite unpopular stance at [/r/gaming](/r/gaming) of being against rape-jokes. And while some people are going not going to change their mind, there were a lot of people who commented who were genuinely curious about the issue - and that was great. newlinechar  newlinechar What saddened me further is that some people who clearly know that rape-jokes are not a good thing to do, were actually reinforcing people in their wrong beliefs because of personal attacks. The fact is that you have to understanding and kind to potentially make people change their stances, attacking them will simply fortify their belief that the 'other-side-is-wrong' and make it harder for those who want to make this world a better place for all of us. newlinechar  newlinechar Although I think the experience was mostly positive, and while I realize this might not really be the 'theme' of this subreddit, if you believe that you are doing the right thing, be mature about about it instead of shoving ideas down people's throats. Not that long ago I was on the other side of this argument, mainly because brought up in a relatively privileged setting and had no idea about how bad it was. There are actually very few people who are 'bad' people.

Not necessarily. The general public that is worried is about their assets in a taken over bank might not oppose the FDIC taking over their bank, but if they all knew beforehand, I would be willing to bet most of the people would remove their money or, at least, enough money to ensure they could survive; these actions would lay bare the complications of the fractional reserve system.  newlinechar  newlinechar The TARP was forced through, after the opposition voted it down the first time; Lehman went into bankruptcy over a weekend because they didn't want to have it happen when the markets opened; company earnings released when the market opens, if shitty, would cause a heavier sell-off due to herd mentality and panic than if the companies allow people too cool off overnight or over the weekend. newlinechar  newlinechar Either way, it is more than a little deceitful, IMHO.

My friends like 'old school', so I've been planning a Pathfinder game for them to meet in the middle (plus I have ideas that won't work in 4e as well). But every time I see someone trash 4e, I put the thing aside and start working on a 4e game just to spite them. newlinechar  newlinechar The thing is that 4e and Pathfinder are different beasts. They have unique strengths and weaknesses as rules systems. I want to run an exploration/adventure style game similar to Indiana Jones, which works better under Pathfinder rules. So I'm running that under Pathfinder. I also have an action fantasy campaign idea that involves lots of stealing from the Sword of Truth TV series, which works better under 4e rules since it's better suited for combat with a party vs. a crapload of enemies. newlinechar  newlinechar I wouldn't try to run a corporate espionage game in the style of Leverage with urban fantasy and cyberpunk elements using Legend of the Five Rings, and I wouldn't try to run an Asian-style period wuxia/samurai game using Shadowrun rules. I don't know why everyone has to rain on everyone else's parade about 4e vs. Pathfinder...

Yeah, if you're not willing to change your position, then there's not much point in discussing it. If you want to get to a place where you might want to become more open, I'd suggest spending more time on skeptical media than specifically atheist media.

Speak for yourself. My grandparents don't listen to that garbage. 
Still doesn't really make sense
why
Vetoing the bill would have been political suicide for 'the spineless prick in the White House.'  The president is already hobbled by Republican opposition in the House and the tenuous edge the Democrats hold in the Senate; vetoing the budget for the American armed forces would play so far into the Republican narratives about wussy Democrats that it would be a holiday for them.  The Republicans could paint Obama as someone who actively wants to weaken America, thereby offending the machismo of conservative hawks and stoking the fear and paranoia that permeates national discourse about terrorism and political Islam.  Clearly, this isn't an accurate picture of Obama at all, but Obama's vast expansion of covert drone wars and presidential detention powers are under- or misreported often enough that the distinction will be lost on the average American voter.  To them, Obama will be the guy who wants the terrorists to hurt America. newlinechar  newlinechar Furthermore, vetoing the bill doesn't energize the Democratic base at all, outside of a handful of the very far-left who believe the military is evil.  In fact, it may alienate more conservative or even moderate Democratic voters who will see 'Obama vetoes military spending bill' all over the news but won't necessarily see why he did so, or the offensive parts of the bill.  Even now, these things are being under-reported in the mainstream media relative to their importance, and I'm willing to bet that whether the average American voter now opposes them is a direct product of how you explain those parts of the bill to him (or her).  Many people will naively assume that only bad guys will be subject to such measures, and since they aren't bad, it's of no consequence to them.  This is the same sentiment that underlies both people's support for better airline security and their disgruntlement about having to actually put up with those measures when they fly.  *I* know I'm not carrying a knife onto the plane, so why do I have to be x-rayed and fondled and stripped half-naked every time I go through security?  Similarly, if *I* know I don't support Al Qaeda, why would I ever get nabbed by the military? newlinechar  newlinechar Furthermore, a veto on principle would not even get him anywhere; assuming he vetoed because he opposed the bill, it would likely have been able to garner the two-thirds majority in both houses needed to override such a veto.  He would have sacrificed enormous political support for both himself and his party for zero gain. newlinechar  newlinechar Basically no politician is a Mr. Smith who will stay true to his core principles and fix the establishment through sheer righteousness.  That's just not how politics works.  Obama's threat of a veto was as much resistance as he could mount without leaving himself exposed.  If playing politics when you're a politician makes you a spineless prick, then I guess Obama is one.  But calling him spineless doesn't change the fact that this bill doesn't really radically change policy Obama had already implemented; it just takes it to a new level.

Though not a direct physical threat the presence of Iraqi WMDs in the region seriously diminished American security in influence. The economic ramifications of rising Iraqi prominence and influence in petroleum trade (following the sharp decline after the first gulf war) were a serious threat to an American economy highly reliant on foreign oil.  newlinechar  newlinechar The implicit power of mass casualty weapons further threatened Israeli (and thus American) military dominance in the region, not to mention American commitment to the protection of Israel. Iraq had fired SCUD missiles into Israel and was known to posses bio-chem capable SCUD warheads.  newlinechar  newlinechar Further, Iraqi ties to anti-American non-state actors meant that any intervention in the region by American forces might be met with retaliation with mass casualty weapons. Iraq could have taken a position of 'A terrorist organization has threatened to use biological weapons against any interdictive forces and/or on American soil, through no influence of the Iraqi state'. So, even though America and Iraq had diplomatic ties after the first gulf war Saddam could pose a viable deterrent to American maneuvering. This was a major concern in the first gulf war and continued to be a serious issue. newlinechar  newlinechar Finally, Saddam was a madman! Under his guidance Iraq launched a *chemical attack* against Iran - the only country to use lethal chemical weapons against humans in modern times.  newlinechar  newlinechar Iraqi possession of WMDs was a threat to American economic stability and regional influence in the Middle East.  newlinechar  newlinechar Despite your views on American neo-colonial policies (which I do not necessarily agree with) the invasion of Iraq due to the threat of WMDs was prescient. Long term policy is divorced from this point. Even if America disengaged from any Middle Eastern affairs the threat of Iraqi weapons would always loom over America and its allies. Iraq *did* pose a threat to not only the United States but any enemy of Saddam, an autocrat with a history of actually deploying implements of asymmetric warfare.

True, radio communications are easier and cheaper to use. But the FCC has already reduced the 'public band' to a tiny portion of what was once a wide-open air, and mandates that these bands be used for voice communications only. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Worse, it's quite common for the FCC to find 'rogue' sources of radio transmissions and track them down. Unlike a satellite, a radio tower is not very hard to find. Then they can slap you with huge fines, turn you in to the RIAA, or just black-bag you in the middle of the night. Their choice. (Don't believe me? A guy in my county gave me this advice on building a cell phone repeater antenna: *don't do it.* Apparently they found his antenna, confiscated it, cut *all* wires going into and out of his house, and left him with a note saying 'don't do it again or worse is coming your way.') newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Personally, a satellite wouldn't really be the most cost-effective, but it would be a huge statement to the enemies of free speech - just like Sputnik was to the Americans, a constant reminder over their heads.

&gt; If a father feels like ditching the kid, it's now his right because it didn't come from his body, and until men can give birth, they don't need to take responsibility for kids.  newlinechar  newlinechar The reason it's in her body in the first place is because of a choice the man made, so he's partially responsible. The problem with removing any responsibility for men in this situation is that it would open up a loophole where a man could go around knocking up any women he hooked up with, without any repercussions. Custody and support laws are unfair, but absolving men of any responsibility is not the solution. I'm not sure what the solution is though... maybe have a pre-fuck agreement before a hook-up, much like a pre-nup before marriage? :/ Not serious of course, I don't know what the solution is. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Again, I'm only advocating this to keep it logically consistent. If the man has no right to tell a woman what to do with her body, then she has no right to hold him accountable for what happened in her body. newlinechar  newlinechar Your statement isn't logically consistent though. If the man has no right to tell a woman what to do with her body, then a woman has no right to tell a man what to do with his body - that is a logically consistent statement. A woman has no right to force a man to give her a child, because the sperm is part of HIS body. That is where men's reproductive rights lie, and where men's rights are logically consistent with a woman's rights to sovereignty over their own bodies.

Though, take the forward momentum into consideration, a forward roll just seems necessary.  newlinechar The roll was a game play aspect in Mirror's Edge (a game worth playing Imo), and I think would make Overgrowth's game play a bit richer.

did you happen to read the [signing statement](http://thinkprogress.org/security/2011/12/31/396018/breaking-obama-signs-defense-authorization-bill/) he wrote about passing it?  newlinechar  newlinechar it was because the bill also authorizes financing for critical DoD programs including programs to assist service members and their families, as well as vital national security programs that had to be renewed.  newlinechar basically, there was ONE part out of over 500 pages he didn't agree with but passing it was necessary to maintain the operation of the military. newlinechar  newlinechar he also stated, “My administration will not authorize the indefinite military detention without trial of American citizens.

No offense taken.  As far as the dream state/waking state issues when I was a kid, those ceased in my early teens.  Sleep paralysis is a symptom of narcolepsy, my half brother is a neurologist and I've talked to him about this at length, it's not a very common side effect but it does occur.  I lapse into it rarely, maybe once a year these days, I know it's my brain malfunctioning but it doesn't relate to when I see/feel ghosts.   newlinechar  newlinechar I've given these occurrences a lot of thought.  I'm as baffled by them as anyone.  I have no investment in the afterlife, no belief structure that explains them, even science falls short of this.  I don't think it's mental, an earlier post describes intelligent and non-intelligent apparitions.  Mine have almost always been non-intelligent.  My theory is these sort of 'energy emissions' are everywhere, just glimpses of people who have passed, non-conscious, non-cognizant, just sort of imprints.  Like how a certain ghost will walk down a certain hallway at a certain hour, it's a video on loop.  Perhaps they suffered a very long drawn out or very emotional death, perhaps somehow because of this they left a marking.  We're all forms of energy, doesn't sound as insane as thinking about an eternal afterlife.  I think most people just wouldn't notice it because it's so outside of our usual world, our brains pattern recognition just pastes over it, they shouldn't be there.  Think how they claim the first Native Americans couldn't see Columbus' ships, it was too far outside of their known world, their brains couldn't process it.  I think my childhood being skewed between a waking/sleeping state and harassed by sleep paralysis and seeing forms in the room that shouldn't be there upon waking has allowed me to see things that normally people wouldn't.  I don't think it's hallucinatory, I don't think I'm sick, I'm a very normal well functioning individual who has no afflictions to report.  Ghosts are something I've grown used to, I've even decided to try to talk to the next one I see to gauge if it is a sentient form or just an apparition.  Normally I just grab for my pillow and huck it at them, they disappear, I don't see them again.  Not sure what any of it means, it doesn't make me believe in an afterlife and it doesn't make me think I'm crazy.
Bullshit. He has the bully pulpit. If any Republicans tried to use the veto against him he could clearly point out that he didn't like the whole GULAG provision and would gladly sign a bill without it. He's trying to blame his **own action** on the Republicans just as he has every other fuckup in his administration. Obamacare wasn't what he wanted, but he still signed it. SOPA won't be what he wanted, but he'll still sign it. He's just found a way to do what he wants and not take any of the blame he deserves. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;To them, Obama will be the guy who wants the terrorists to hurt America. newlinechar  newlinechar You're attempting to blame his actions on a potential reaction of the American voter? That perfectly underscores my characterization of him as a spineless prick.  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Furthermore, vetoing the bill doesn't energize the Democratic base at all, outside of a handful of the very far-left who believe the military is evil. newlinechar  newlinechar I really don't give a shit of what electoral effects he might face for not doing something horribly wrong. Your entire argument seems to hinge on the logic that he might hurt his chances of being re-elected if he doesn't authorize GULAGs and that that should excuse his actions. newlinechar  newlinechar Fuck him. He and any Congressman that voted on this bill have committed treason and should be recalled or impeached at the nearest opportunity.

To be fair, it was accidental. Fines and penalties are usually applied more strongly/harshly when it's clear that the intent was to screw over consumers (cf the Harvey Norman thing that's just come to light). Fining a small fish and chip shop for everything they have and more over something like this just wouldn't be good for anybody, as well as being needlessly harsh (think 'making an example of you'). newlinechar  newlinechar I don't doubt for a second though that the employee in question is going to be thrown under a fucking bus for this, and I'm torn on whether or not they deserve it. On the one hand, accidents happen, regardless of what all the simpering HR goons would have you believe. On the other hand, caustic soda is stored in clearly-marked containers with safety lids - nothing at all like a bulk salt container.

It's difficult to pin down exactly why Japan has such a low interest rate.  Allow me to regurgitate a story my capital markets professor told my class: newlinechar  newlinechar Apparently, in WWII, while Japan was being bombed, the Japanese banks were adamant about continuing to make payments on their debt as scheduled.  Such was the commitment to meeting obligations that the markets are very lenient when it comes to debt regarding Japan. newlinechar  newlinechar Now, i'm not sure about the veracity of this story (although I doubt my professor would make it up), but it goes a ways to indicate the various variables the markets utilizes.  It's hard to use a single indicator and expect it to yield a reliable estimate.  For example, Italy has a high % of public debt held internally, yet still face high spreads.
I'm saying curiosity will never go completely away, but there's consequences to acting upon them that are both spiritual and psychological.  In most cases, it's not worth it.

There's no reason to add more baggage.

I don't know enough about Steinem to say whether what you wrote is true, but I want to know - where is the point where we have to denounce/ignore everything a person ever said because of what else they said/did? You seem to say that there is such a point. I think there is no such a point. Sure, I wouldn't want to run around quoting Hitler, but he may have once said something very eloquent and true about potatoes. Do you think his judgement about potatoes was impaired because he was otherwise a psychopathic, delusional, murderous asshole? newlinechar  newlinechar Do you think Steinem's judgement about religion is impaired because she said and did transphobic things?  newlinechar  newlinechar Or, and this just came to me, is your objection not against the quote itself but simply about promoting her name? But then again, why is Hitchens's misogyny 'forgiven' but not her transphobia? (After all, even if in your opinion Hitchens's actions weren't as 'bad' as Steinem's, they certainly displayed a particular worldview - like his support for the Iraq war, btw. If we know someone has a particular worldview, even if s/he never acted on it, how is that 'better' than someone who acts on said worldview when discussing whether their ideas regarding other topics can be considered or not?)
Often, I'd say indoctrination. But even indoctrination relies on arguments from evidence. For example, for Christians, original sin explains natural evil and human evil. The orderly nature of their lives is taken as evidence. None of this is scientific or even what we'd call rational, but it's also not pure 'faith'.
I would clarify that you all are trying to raise donations via this video. I felt midway through like 'Am I really watching a video of someone telling me they are going to make a documentary'.

I think this is a cute cat!
When they were originally conceived, it was to give you a more cinematic experience/moment that they couldn't have otherwise implemented into the game as an unscripted occurrence. You only have so many buttons on a controller and it's difficult to make them do everything. To use God of War as an example, you've got your light and heavy attacks, specials, block, dodge roll, etc. but there's no place for the 'fling yourself into the sky and land on this boss's face and stab him' attack considering it's a one time event that will only show up at that point in the game.  newlinechar  newlinechar Where else do you put it? What other solution is there other than a QTE? You could leave it out entirely and make the fight far less cinematic, or you can remove the interaction and make it a cutscene/scripted event with no player control. In both cases, it's lose/lose, whereas the QTE gives you a middle ground where you get both the cinematic experience of a cutscene, but the interaction of gameplay.  newlinechar  newlinechar It's also not a 'fake' sense of control when there are very real consequences in the game when you fail to tackle them properly. Also, where do we draw the line between QTE and player input? *Technically*, Heavy Rain is one long QTE, but it's handled wonderfully. And what about Batman: AA/AC? The combat in it is incredibly rhythmic and feels very QTE-ish when you get into brawls and all you do is press the right button at the right time. In terms of how they *control*, the input is no different than when you're flying through the air as Kratos; All that's changed is you don't have to wait around as long for a scripted animation to finish with a fancy camera angle. So if that's the case, is the camera the only thing that qualifies it as a QTE, or are we considering one of the best games of 2011 a giant QTE? newlinechar  newlinechar Now, I'm not trying to be a crusader for QTEs mind you. It's that, unlike you, I don't think all QTEs are bad, but that there are good QTEs and bad QTEs. A QTE where I have to, say, dodge pillars that fall on the ground when I, the player, could've easily done that myself (PoP'08)? Not good. A QTE that lacks dynamic variables and only gives you a win/lose option for completing it correctly (ala RE4/5)? Also bad. QTEs that add an interactive and cinematic layer to the gameplay that could not be achieved without QTEs (GoW)? Good. QTEs with dynamic variables that give you multiple choices, options, and routes for completion (Heavy Rain)? Also good! newlinechar  newlinechar Like most things in life, there is no black and white answer. I think people are so quick to chalk up QTEs as a bad thing when they don't even realize what it's really adding to the game (for better or worse).

&gt;What evidence exists that it [homosexuality] is not a disorder? newlinechar  newlinechar It's not about if it's a mental disorder or not. It's about WHAT is a disorder or not. A mental disorder can be defined as a a state of mind of a person who can't function in society. Like people who are highly paranoid, people that can't get over physical abuses, people that can't work because of disabilities, etc. When an individual reach a clearly defined state based on objectives criteria, then you can have a consensus about mental disorder.  newlinechar  newlinechar If you look at homosexuality, you can't really say it's the source of any mental or intellectual incapacity. Homosexuals can be depressed because of social stigmata, but they can get over it. In fact, like a lot of problems that arise from individual tastes, choices, interests and what not, homosexuality can be (and I god damned hope) a source of pride, joy and satisfaction like ANY kind of love life. newlinechar  newlinechar In fact, if we let sexuality become an criteria for mental disorders, then obviously, incest should be a case of mental disorder. You sexually abuse your child? You are insane (as opposed to an horrible parent). You like bondage? God damn crazy freak! Anal? Oh god, that IS insane. And don't get me started on those weird ass couchsexuals. newlinechar  newlinechar Mental disorders diagnostics shouldn't be based on subjective criteria. Most of the time, people saying that homosexuality is a mental disorder are either ignorant of the meaning of mental disorder in a medical context or are judgmental. newlinechar  newlinechar /edit newlinechar It's like deciding if a tomato is a fruit or vegetable. Botanist tells us it's a fruit, because it develops from a flower's ovaries and contains seeds. But cooks tells us it's a vegetable because it contain almost no sugars (like normal fruits) and a lot of glutamic acid and aromatic sulfur compounds which makes them great with meat, like other vegetables. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Even the United States Supreme Court has preferred the cook’s definition to the botanist’s. In the 1890s, a New York food importer claimed duty-free status for a shipment of tomatoes, arguing that tomatoes were fruits, and so under the regulations of the time, not subject to import fees. The customs agent ruled that tomatoes were vegetables and imposed a duty. A majority of the Supreme Court decided that tomatoes were “usually served at a dinner in, with, or after the soup, fish, or meat, which constitute the principal part of the repast, and not, like fruits, generally as dessert.” Ergo tomatoes were vegetables, and the importer had to pay. newlinechar  newlinechar There is a infinite cleavage between what you define mental disorder as and what the general consensus of it is. So what do you decide, let psychologists define mental disorder or define it based on your own reflexions?
I have used just about any type of bean there is, and usually just go with what is cheapest. Right now, that is pinto at my Walmart. You can adjust the seasonings to the beans you use.

When done, remove the chicken and bring the broth to a boil. Once boiling, add a bag of noodles and cook until done. While the noodles are cooking, pick the chicken off the bone. When the noodles are done, add the chicken back to the pot and you have easy peasy chicken and noodles.

I tend to think that debate has turned into such an ugly word almost synonymous to 'argue' which conjures even darker connotations.

Scoliosis and a bad lower back qualify as 'compelling' reasons to stay away from squats and deads, I think. Hopefully whatever caused your lower back injury is something you're working on rehabbing - speaking from experience, that can take you out of commission on virtually anything if it worsens. I do see squats and deadlifts in your fitocracy log though - what gives? newlinechar  newlinechar I'm surprised that you're able to do pendlay rows, DB squats, shrugs, leg press, etc. given what you've described, too, because those all involve various degrees of spinal loading. newlinechar  newlinechar To answer your questions, 'presses, legs, and pulls' does not in and of itself a good routine make. In a VERY broad sense, you're covering all the bases, but beyond that a lot depends on what type of goals you have. Nearly every routine, regardless of stated goal, will have one or more 'work sets' of a compound movement at heavy weight for few repetitions. Bodybuilding programs will involve a lot more volume (total weight lifted) for the targetted muscles beyond these sets, and are generally broken down more specifically than push/pull/legs (e.g. chest, tris/bis, back, legs, abs/shoulders). Strength-oriented programs will tend towards less total volume and are usually not as subdivided. newlinechar  newlinechar I've probably typed a lot more than I needed to here - at the end of the day, if you're lifting more weight, or the same weight for more repetitions, each time you go to the gym, then your program is not 'useless', at least (and what you're doing is certainly miles better than a lot of 'I came up with this myself!' plans I've seen over the years) - but even if you're not able or willing to switch to one of the well-established lifting routines, you should probably make an effort to structure your training more in the way I've described - centering around one or two compound movements a day at high weight for lower reps, and then assistance work as desired, depending on your goals.

Interesting. In the version I played, there was very little choice early on because there were a bunch of high-level block spaces funneling you into whatever course you're supposed to take for each character. It wasn't until late in the game that the characters' paths started overlapping a lot.

That's a load of crap and you know it.  You are arguing that if we treat the animals badly now, it makes it less likely that everyone will convert to veganism? newlinechar  newlinechar Seriously? People who have made the decision of eating humanely raised livestock animals are also likely to eat a more flexible diet consisting of a lot less meat than most meat eaters. newlinechar  newlinechar Production-wise, you cannot raise the sheer amount of animals in a humane and ethical environment that you can in these shit-filled factory farms. There is a limited amount of land available for farming, and humane and ethical farming methods need more space for each animal, so again, how will it lead to more animals suffering? A humanely raised and killed animal will not suffer, provided it is well cared for and killed instantly either with a bullet to the brain, or by other *instant* method.  newlinechar  newlinechar Veganism is as unnecessary as being a carnivore, but we all have our own ethics, and belief structures. Always fight for your side, but if you think that this is all it would take to dismiss veganism as unnecessary, you're doing it wrong. You should be a vegan, vegetarian, pescatarian, whatever you want, because it's right for you. If you're side is right, fight for that, but when you say that continuing factory farming, instead of outlawing it, and having regulations put in place that promote humane and ethical treatment of livestock, you sound completely ignorant.

Game plan: newlinechar  newlinechar The easiest way to determine what you want to do is to find units you like to use, and use them. It will take you a long ways from the lower leagues.  newlinechar  newlinechar You seem to like marines/tanks/medivacs, so just work on improving on it. Ramp up your production and try getting faster/more upgrades. You are already on track for that, you just need to practice a bit more. newlinechar  newlinechar I'm sorry if I wasn't clear about this, but you don't need to work upgrades into your build order explicitly (e.g. on ~60 supply or whatever). Have a general idea of when you want them. After Starport? Before 3rd? After 3rd? Those types of things you should determine for yourself. newlinechar  newlinechar --- newlinechar  newlinechar Expanding:  newlinechar  newlinechar Sorry I stopped watching at ~16 minutes. I felt the game was over as he had 2/2 on the way with hive and infestors on 4 base, vs your 2 base 1/0; I didn't see you take a 3rd. Nonetheless, you should have a 3rd by then. newlinechar  newlinechar Take bases as you feel you can secure them. That's the easiest way to start practicing. Remember PForts and missile turrets are quite good at dealing with light harassment, but if he gets a very large number of mutas you will have an annoyance with them. That's why its a good idea to expand towards Zerg. It's harder for him to run around. Shakuras is fairly unique. newlinechar  newlinechar --- newlinechar  newlinechar Planning: newlinechar  newlinechar So, I play and try to have fun. My game plan TvZ is a lot of upgraded marines, with some siege tanks, but mostly marines. I know it isn't the best strategy and I'll have to adjust it to get into GM, but its what I enjoy doing. newlinechar  newlinechar I encourage you to do the same. If you like siege tanks, make 2 factories instead of one. If you like marines, make a lot of reactored barracks. newlinechar  newlinechar However, every match will reach the same point: Brood Lords/Ultras/Infestors.  newlinechar  newlinechar You need to be ready for this tech powerhouse Zerg will eventually throw at you. Don't be surprised when it happens, so be ready to make Ghost/Viking. newlinechar  newlinechar Besides that, practice. Do what you enjoy but make sure you are macro'ing and keeping your money low. I guarantee you if you constantly make workers and units and stay below 500/500 you will win every game through Gold and even maybe halfway through Plat, regardless of Strategy. newlinechar  newlinechar --- newlinechar  newlinechar I hope that answered your questions. newlinechar  newlinechar GLGL

You are right, but while a the physical satellite itself may be difficult to reach, jamming it is not really a problem.

I'm not going to downvote you since it isn't your article but this person is intentionally misleading people in order to get away from this problem. He points out something that he calls 'parallel material' regarding Jacob and Leah - 'Here, 'hated' is clearly used synonymously with one who is loved less. Let it be added that if Jacob hated Leah in a literal way, it is hardly believable that he would consent to take her as his wife at all' What he fails to mention is that we are talking about two different words here (two different languages, in fact).

It might be better suited for a game where shooting isn't the main focus but rather an element of gameplay, such as a first person RPG. That said, it would be tough to implement it in a way that doesn't irritate the player.

First off, thank you for the in depth reply. It's rare to get some serious discourse on here. I also apologize if I came off as condescending, it was not my intention. It's hard denote fervor in plain text. I also write as I speak. Please forgive my stream of consciousness fueled excesses. Which leads me to... newlinechar  newlinechar Since I write like I talk, I don't include footnotes or sources. I don't feel the need or have the time to provide you with all the pdfs, TheOilDrum.com articles, quoting Chris Martenson, or Hubbert, or ARAMCO VPs, or EROEI, or Malthus, or exponential growth curves over time, etc. I think it's on you to find that material and absorb it yourself. To me, finding relevant data organically makes the connections between  divergent concepts easier to grasp. Plus it helps alleviate thinking in a vacuum. newlinechar  newlinechar Sooo... newlinechar  newlinechar Addressing specifically the 3-5 years number:  The Joint Chiefs of Staff briefed Obama in 2009/2010 that the U.S.'s imported oil deficit will the be in the neighborhood of 10mbpd. 10 million barrels *per day* shortage by today's consumption models. newlinechar  newlinechar So, in order to put this into perspective, you gotta understand that 10mbpd is a huge fucking number. Ghawar, Saudi Arabia's biggest oil well (biggest in the world, really), puts out 5mbpd at maxed refining/production. We need two more Ghawars to satisfy our negative export margin, and that's just to meet projected consumption. Oil discoveries also peaked, world-wide in 1964 with production estimated at peak around 2005-7. We are on the way down. Furthermore, all of the oil exporters (save the Saudis, but they aren't far behind) are close to terminal on exports as their own internal consumption is meeting with available exports; crossing them out. Tough choices. newlinechar  newlinechar You know, the whole oil thing, it pretty much permeates any rational thought about the world and it's politics. I mean hell, our very wealth here in the United States, is tied to oil. The Petro-Dollar. As long as we are tied to that, we will be fine. But, then again, what happens when the oil runs out? Or gets too expensive to extract? Can we possibly pay back the trillions we owe? If so, with what? Our hegemony, while impressive in quick-cut montages of super-cool tanks with active and DU armour, un-manned drones with Air-to-Surface missiles whose pilots sit in gameing rigs out in the Nevada desert, tacticool badasses with gunceptions. I mean, it all looks pretty great, until you realize the trade-off for having all that shit... newlinechar  newlinechar The world is not better for the average human being. I mean, dude, for real, look all around you. First world countries cannot enjoy the lifestyle they enjoy unless someone does the hard work for less. Pretty simple shit. If we payed a normalized price, respectful of the people who made it, etc, then our median pay would look a lot like Soviet Russia or the People's republic. Just like the Spartans, we have our military, whose weapons and nifty gadgets are made possible because we use prison labor (propped up by the War on Drugs) to make em, we enslave the 3rd world to make us our everything and wrap it up real nice and call it Globalism(how many suicides at the Foxconn factory in China? All for Jobs and Co to have a better bottom line), instead of devoting that massive effort towards something sustainable and peaceful. We cashed in our ticket. We chose war. We chose profit. We chose exploitation. newlinechar  newlinechar Times, I assume you are in the U.S., are in fact, not getting better. Adjusted for inflation, the median wage in the U.S. peaked around 1970-71, which coincidentally enough, is the same year that the U.S. also peaked in oil production. This is not a coincidence. We have since used our 'capital' to trade for oil. For cars. For jets. For tanks. There seems to be this idealized version of what America is, but it sure as shit ain't glossy and white-washed, as you've stated. The British and U.S. overthrew the democratically elected ruler of Iran to put the Shah in power, who in turn would sell us and our friends their oil on the cheap. It made everyone but the Iranian people rich. There's a lot more where that comes from. We set the table, and play the banker, and change the rules for anyone who plays with us. We call is nation building. newlinechar  newlinechar Let me ask you, what has the internet, these billions of fiat pieces of paper, what have they done? In real, brass tacks terms. Has the internet made us a better species? I would posit, fuck no. To me, it reinforces unsuccessful traits and creates intellectual ghettos. But that's not really relevant to the idea here... newlinechar  newlinechar The overall point of all this, is as follows: The American empire, while seeming invincible in all world affairs, is but a husk of an idea. We have used up all of the cheap and easy energy to fuel corporate-military conquest. Like every civilization before us. The Roman empire, in it's finality was never cohesive for long. It was an amoeba. It evolved. It never collapsed in the Michael Bay sense. newlinechar  newlinechar I want to leave you with a question. If the abundance of excess energy (100+ EROEI) was the catalyst for the human population explosion (don't worry, it is) then what will sustain the human population when that abundant excess energy is gone? How will we manufacture, deliver, monetize and implement it?

Well, I mean, clearly there's political support for this kind of action somewhere, otherwise it wouldn't have been added to the bill at all.  Suppose Obama does veto the bill, thereby killing his political career, and Congress wasn't able to muster the majority required to overturn the veto despite broad bipartisan support for it; is the next president and the next Congress going to be so principled?  Obama inherited a lot of fucked up policies from George Bush, and instead of canning them, he expanded them and added some new ones (as far as we know).  What's to stop the next guy from doing the same? newlinechar  newlinechar Also, 'the bully pulpit' isn't what it used to be.  The internet and agenda journalism (think Fox News) both make it possible for people to never come into contact with opinions - and political spin - they don't want to hear.  We're now far removed from the era where the president could go directly to the people and expect a majority of those people to hear him out.  Partisanship matters more than anything, despite how much people claim to be tired of it.  Fox News would have vilified him for being a coward who was handing victory to America's enemies, more mainstream news pundits would have gone back and forth over how big of a mistake Obama had made, and the actual reasons for vetoing the bill would have been glossed over and drowned out by a thoroughly controlled mainstream media and gallons of political spin. newlinechar  newlinechar Besides, Obama's actions so far seem to indicate he supports ANY expansion of state power, regardless of what he actually claims he wants.

More on advancing guard: use it when he's doing the triple attacks so that the 2nd and 3rd parts of the sword movement whiff (the same way you push block akuma's tatsu so that he ends up standing next to you in recovery frames). Many moves are safe on block, but no move is safe on whiff. Then you unload bars into and kill his low health. If you end with him at 10% health and a lot of red life he is likely to hard tag out because most zeroes focus on him - so block high and get ready to punish the hard tag. newlinechar  newlinechar Also he almost always regular jumps, calls assist, and teleport/lightning thing behind, so watch for the assist calls as a clue that teleport is coming (same with a lot of characters). At least you'll know where to block even if you can't punish it.

It's unlikely he did so for free. The husband has claimed that Paul never sent them a bill, but it does not mean that Paul was not reimbursed.  newlinechar  newlinechar Furthermore, I find it remarkable that you think that Paul is the sort of person who, if racist, would have withheld medical services in order to harm the woman and child. You must not think too much of him. As an FYI, the medical school Paul attended was flamboyantly racist at the time he was there, refusing to admit any black students or hire any black faculty--and yet, they still had one segregated, poorly staffed ward for black people. Even those bigots would not completely turn away a black person in service of their bigotry. I'm surprised you think Paul if racist, would surpass them in callousness.  newlinechar  newlinechar

With the way you think, I imagine every middle-eastern person must scare you with the thought of them being a terrorist or a potential terrorist, that would be racist. Again, that's based off of what **YOU** said about **MUSLIMS**.You're a douche, simply put. And Nothing is wrong with being a liberal, just as nothing is wrong with being a conservative. I'm surprised that with the religion that you chose, that you happen to show hatred towards those who have done no wrong towards you. After all, I'm sure if Jesus was real, and he came knocking on your door, he wouldn't be very happy with the things you were saying. He defnitely wouldn't pick you to represent Christianity. Why don't you be more Christ-like and quit the hatred. Embrace culture and embrace differences in culture from your own. Quit being a gigantic bigot towards those who live differently than you. newlinechar  newlinechar I'll add as well, it's people like you who were the Catalyst to turn me away from Christianity for all it's hypocracy, lies, deceit, and corruption that occurs in the house of the lord. You honestly should be ashamed of yourself for the way you behave. newlinechar  newlinechar edit: newlinechar  newlinechar One more thing, THIS IS NOT A CHRISTIAN NATION. The founding fathers who wrote the constitution intended this country to be tolerant of religion and not to be a nation representing a single religion over others. If this was supposed to be a Christian nation, they would have explicitly put that in there. But it's nowhere in there. They weren't christians in any real shape or form. They were Diests, which is different, they didn't truly believe that Jesus is everyone's savior, and some others didn't even believe in a god but believe that Jesus existed as a person and not as a prophet, revering him for his goodwill, and a model for others, but that's it.

I think having a maximum fine of $500 is far too weak though. Sure in this case you probably wouldn't need to go much over $1000 before the fine becomes a burden to the continued operation of the business, but if somewhere like McDonalds or KFC were to do this they should be issued a much larger fine, not because the crime is worse, but because the burden placed on the business should be relative. newlinechar  newlinechar Please note the word SHOULD, I know this isn't how it works in the real world.

right, i forgot obama made it illegal to call them lights. newlinechar  newlinechar they are cigarettes that generally have white filters, used to be called lights, and usually come in white or silver packs. they have less flavor, and someone who prefers more flavorful cigarettes simply won't smoke one because it won't satisfy his craving and will taste like shit to him. newlinechar  newlinechar menthols are very particular. people either love them or hate them. this is another example where people will outright refuse a smoke you offer. newlinechar  newlinechar something to note - some people consider thin or long smokes 'girly', don't offer one to a burly dude (or just don't get them if you're buying to offer friends at parties). newlinechar  newlinechar also, you're a good man. bringing a pack of smokes to a party is just a GGG move as bringing a case of beer IMO.

At least, up until the 12th grade (which is the last year of pre-college education).  Public universities/colleges (the term is mostly interchangeable) are subsidized by the state, but those do cost money to attend, though far less than private universities. newlinechar  newlinechar The quality of schools vary.  Some public schools struggle with discipline issues, and the teachers spend as much time trying to keep students pacified as they do teaching (which is pretty bad) where others do a very good job because the students are more well-behaved (usually in more affluent neighborhoods).  The choice of school is typically determined by where you live (the schools are designated for a certain area) though there is room for some exceptions.  Parents therefore worry about which neighborhood they live in and whether it's near a 'good' school. newlinechar  newlinechar The idea is private schools are expensive and most black families can't afford such schools and so they go to public schools.  Private schools have a reputation of being a bit posh (though probably nowhere near what it is in the UK where class differences are very pronounced). newlinechar  newlinechar The public schools are paid indirectly by state taxes.

They lose the right to exclude. It's analogous to the principles behind trespassing (e.g. Jacques v. Steenberg Homes where the trespass didn't do any physical damage, but it violated the right to exclude and the plaintiffs were awarded $100,000 in punitive damages). You have the right to stop people from using your personal property. You have the right to keep people off your real property.

I really loved spiders as a child. I lived in Texas at the time and had a German neighbor whom owned a female Tarantula and two Rattlesnakes. He used to take me out in his Jeep in the evening during the Summer to look for Tarantulas keeping warm on the pavement. I caught a female one night (with Grasshopper bait in a jar laid sideways in front of her) and tried to take her home. Mom freaked, so I gave her to the neighbor.  newlinechar  newlinechar It wasn't until I watched them feed and become defensive when he changed their water bowls that I started to not like them so much. I realized their potential, and their creepy defense mechanisms and movements. Over the years, it spiraled into full-on arachnophobia. I don't mind the small spiders as much, but once they're beyond 2 in. in diameter I seize up and hyperventilate. It must have been initiated at just the right time in my psychological development, because it's very engrained. I don't think I could ever be cured of it. newlinechar  newlinechar I still like to gain knowledge on spiders, though, which is why I'm subscribed to r/spiders. It's a love/hate relationship I suppose.  newlinechar  newlinechar Fun side story: the German neighbor's first Tarantula appeared to be dead, so he took her to a nearby lake and dumped her on the sand. She immediately stood up and ran away. Fucking *faked her death*! Or, so it seems. Still a mystery. Another time, he came home from the lake with an old Coca-Cola tin can (cube-shaped, large enough to store about 12 cans of Coke) and he called me over. 'Jared, I have to show you something!' I lean over the container, and he proceeds to pull off the lid. Inside is a fucking coiled-up [Water Moccasin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agkistrodon_piscivorus)!

One of the reason health insurance is so expensive is due to intervention of the state in private markets. As it stands now, minor things like flu shots and birth control are mandated (by the state) to be covered by insurance companies. This means that premiums go up because insurance companies DO need to make money and you can't do that when you mandate every medical related thing be covered.  It'd be like if we mandated car insurance providers provide floor mats and air fresheners. Everyone would buy them because those costs are distributed throughout the system, so their premiums will not go up OR down if they buy the products or do not, so it is more advantageous to buy them. This is why health insurance has ballooned in price in the last two decades. Please...do not tell me an industry regulated to death (and when 50% of that industry is government spending) that that industry is in a free market...

Yes, but it isn't terribly effective as a singular birth control method either, so it's much more important to get the message out there about the most effective birth control methods such as condoms, hormonal BC, IUDs, Plan B, etc. Most of these (IUDs excluded) require some sort of consistent human intervention, but pulling out requires the most at the most inhumanly possible moment to exercise judgment!

I was thinking more of what Paul Ryan has done, what it means, why he did it (that post about him making money buy subsiding energy companies, would be good ammo).

Starts out with the founding fathers, in the background, with text saying 'America was founded by the best and the brightest that we had to offer', and then voice over of 'We find that all men are created equal...'

Followed by different presidents/congresses making stands on tough issues, i.e. Lincoln freeing the slaves (inspirational quote with context), FDR (Nothing to fear but fear itself), Kennedy (Cuban Missile Crisis), Ronald Regan ('Tear down this wall'), need something with congress in there. Then picture of Paul Ryan saying and with text about him voting on bills to make himself money. End with something 'like for more than 200 years we have fought for freedom and equality, and now instead of the best and brightest we have the biggest liars and the most corrupt' (I feel this isn't the way to end it but something that is a historical statement.

There are lots of ways to compute pi, using successive approximation.  You can start with some arbitrary number, perform a series of intermediate steps on that number, and examine the result after each step.  The result will converge toward pi, so you just keep going until you get some arbitrary level of precision. newlinechar  newlinechar For example, newlinechar  newlinechar pi = 4 - 4/3 + 4/5 - 4/7 + 4/9 - ... newlinechar  newlinechar This takes forever to get an answer, but it gets there.  After the 999th term of this expression, pi is approximated as 3.1426, and after the 1000th term it's approximated as 3.1406, so we've proven that pi is 3.14... newlinechar  newlinechar There are expressions that converge faster that are more complicated to write out. newlinechar  newlinechar

This is such a complicated question. I definitely think if there was one instance of violence, it definitely needs to be addressed and discussed, but I hesitate to label one isolated instance, with no other controlling behaviors, as abuse necessarily.  newlinechar  newlinechar Abuse/domestic violence is so ingrained in my mind as being about power and control. If it was really just one isolate incident with no other controlling behavior occurring, it would still be wrong and bad, but I would hesitate to say abuse right off the bat. I would want to it investigated to see if the relationship was abusive, like I would definitely say the people involved needed to talk and discuss the incident, perhaps with a mediator or counselor. I'm not an expert on domestic violence, and someone who is might say something different.  newlinechar  newlinechar I think some people would argue that because it is violence in a domestic situation, it would necessarily be domestic violence, but I just think that's simplistic and would want to learn more about their relationship and the events surrounding the incident before I said it was domestic violence. There are some serious power issues which can arise in any domestic situation.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Let's think about a situation where it's two people in a bar, and one person gets into a fight with the other after some serious heavy drinking. I think that's what I was thinking about when I said one isolated incident, just replace bar with home. It's not necessarily about power and control in that situation necessarily. It's about drinking and out of control behavior that needs to be addressed. It's still wrong and bad.

What you are trying to recall is that most printers have no way to accurately determine how much ink is left in a cartridge. There is no sensor, so they attempt to guess how much is left by how often that cartridge has been used. Most of them are conservative, the idea being that you replace the cartridge *before* you get half-way through an 8x10 photo and run out. Like all estimates, its based on assumptions, meaning that there are almost certainly pathological cases were its simply wrong. So there is a chance you'll print a lot of stuff that matches those odd cases and it'll be way off in its guess. newlinechar  newlinechar All of the printers that I've personally owned that did this had methods to either force them to continue printing, no matter how much ink they 'thought' was left (Lexmark), or the cartridge could be 'reset' in some way (Epson).
I love Ron Paul, but if he doesn't win the Republican nomination(he most likely won't) and runs as an independent, we could have a Democratic version of Ross Perot.

Paul will get the young professionals/educated vote because they are looking for a change from the normal, not realizing that the president *Really cant do that much with a uncompromising legislature*, barring executive order.

For example, Mississippi, in the heart of the bible belt, recently voted on [Initiative 26](http://ballotpedia.org/wiki/index.php/Mississippi_Life_Begins_at_the_Moment_of_Fertilization_Amendment,_Initiative_26_(2011)).  I won't go into detail (I'm sure you know how to work the internet :)), but suffice it to say it was anti-abortion, pro-personhood, and anti-contraceptives (in some forms).  It was voted out 58% to 42%.  While it was a little too close for comfort, it was still voted out.  The anti-abortion sentiment is extremely strong in this state, and I can vouch for that first hand, yet it still didn't pass. newlinechar  newlinechar I know this is anecdotal, but it's hard to disagree with the results.  At a local level, even in a state such as Mississippi with organizations convincing (lying to) constituents that the bill was merely anti-abortion and nothing more (you should have seen the billboards and other things), the people pulled through and voted in favor of choice, freedom, liberty, or whatever you want to call it. newlinechar  newlinechar At the very least, giving the power to state and more local government gives us more control.  It certainly doesn't give us absolute control, but it gives us *more* control. newlinechar  newlinechar Ron Paul isn't perfect, and I disagree with some of his positions, but these are generally minor in relation to the more important things like our absolutely ludicrous government spending, the obvious bias toward corporations, and the rampant corruption, among other things. newlinechar  newlinechar What kind of equilibrium do you propose and which candidates support your propositions? newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Edit: reddit's syntax didn't like a link ending in parentheses, so here's the link --&gt; http://ballotpedia.org/wiki/index.php/Mississippi_Life_Begins_at_the_Moment_of_Fertilization_Amendment,_Initiative_26_(2011) 
&gt;Religion is a type of superstition if it is not true. newlinechar  newlinechar No, I believe he was correct.  newlinechar  newlinechar Religion need not be based on miracles/supernatural processes. I feel this is where stark anti-theism becomes ridiculous. Your conception of 'religion' is too narrow. While any religion that contains miracles, according to Spinoza, is indeed superstitious (and thereby false), not every religion out there contains supernatural phenomena.

Yep.  Hate to say it, but there's only so many buttons on a controller, and some PC games, older ones in particular, take full advantage of a keyboard.  Some games would be flat impossible to make for consoles, even if the hardware can handle it (e.g. Falcon 4, or ARMA2) just because there's no possible way to map all the controls needed.  For X-Wing, you'd need buttons to change your rate of laser/shield recharge, energy transfer from laser to shield and vice versa, shield distribution, laser firing mode, throttle (including match target speed setting), pitch, yaw, roll, fire laser, 6 targeting options, 8 wingman commands, view change (three camera positions plus 2-axis free camera), eject, map, damage report, change weapons, deploy S-Foils, jump to hyperspace, and several other controls.  Some might be combined or eliminated, but then you're sacrificing the flexibility of the controls and making them harder to use.  No one has yet topped the PC keyboard in terms of sheer flexibility and number of commands.

Fructose elicits very little insulin response, as it's virtually 100% metabolized in the liver. This is why it's considered to be unhealthy unless you're doing heavy endurance activity that depletes liver glycogen. This is also why people thought for many years that it was safer than glucose; strictly from a glycemic index point of view (how fast it's absorbed, how much it spikes insulin) it appears to be way better. Same deal with high-fructose sweeteners, like agave, that still are considered by the mainstream to be somehow better than sugar.
That's what happens when jargon needs to be expanded. It exists to make new arguments concise in light of existing ones.

I am with the common Libertarian belief that the FCC was created in response to the statist problem that the market had nearly solved the problem on its own of dividing the spectrum through common law agreements that could have grown to harm the entrenched establishment. newlinechar  newlinechar It is what the State calls 'fairness'. newlinechar  newlinechar Something similarly related that is upsetting is the USDA taking authority over the term 'organic'. 'Organic' rose out of peoples concerns over what was going into our food supply. The fight was very messy and it was difficult to discover what people using the term meant. This situation eventually evolved into a variety of certification organizations making the process better and easier for the consumer to understand. Once this began to threaten established farming practices, the USDA jumps in to save everybody and come up with their own definition of organic that would be 'fair' to everybody. This ended the debate, discussion over. No more evolution in that fight.

Your articles are making unfounded extrapolations.  The first mentions that excess weight is more problematic than running for joint pain, then states that running is good at burning calories.  This does not mean that running is good for your joints, as there are other means that do not stress your joints to lose that weight. newlinechar  newlinechar A study in the second one measured runners against a healthy control that did not have an exercise plan.  As it had already mentioned that ANY exercise is good for the joints, this was not a well controlled study.  The other observational studies measured exercise, not running. newlinechar  newlinechar If you like running, do it, but don't claim it is good for your joints.

You think that it's as easy as sending it back to the legislative branch?  You think so highly of Congress, I see.  Sending it back would cause a rise in unemployment until an NDAA can be passed.

You think that if you send it back to Congress, they'll have a new, better bill in 2 weeks?  No, they will override his veto and Obama will ultimately be seen as a troublemaker.

Right. Chuck used to have a really emotionally powerful effect on me because the writing was almost always great and really made me attached to the characters and engaged in their struggles - like Chuck's feelings for Sarah, or his search for his dad.  newlinechar  newlinechar Lately, I find everything packs less of a punch, like those emotional moments can't convey the same feelings anymore simply because in other areas, the writing has been falling short. Like the writers don't seem to care anymore. It's distancing me from the characters in a way that has an indirect effect on my enjoyment of the great parts, too. Which makes me worried about the season finale, because I really want something worthy of Chuck, but after the last couple of seasons, I don't know how it's possible to feel satisfied by much of what they do. newlinechar  newlinechar It was great to finally find out why we haven't seen Sarah's mother, but you'd think they've spent enough time planning that part out to not have it be a plothole-ridden mess as well.

We were both awkward penguin/forever alone types who were pretty decent friends.  The sex was terrible to non-existent, but we really had nothing to compare it to.  She was literally my first dating/sexual relationship.   newlinechar  newlinechar That said, a huge proportion of people, well over 50%, who are married or in an LTR at the beginning of graduate school are divorced by the end.  Part of it is that grad students are just miserable a lot of the time and it bleeds over in to personal life. newlinechar  newlinechar I will say that I enjoyed being able to share sciency things with my ex.  Our fields are close enough that we could communicate our enthusiasms with a little work.  The thing about grad students/postdocs/assistant professors, though, is that live and breathe our science.  I've discovered that I'm quite happy to be with someone who loves me, who wants me to be happy, but who doesn't want to hear about my experiments...because I'm already fucking sick of them by the time I get home. newlinechar  newlinechar The only successful academic partnerships I know of are people in the same field who decide that one of them will be the 'figurehead' and the other will keep the lab running.  One of you will HAVE to sacrifice their academic career to support the other.  Scientists, especially in academia, are expected to devote everything they have to Science - and that means going wherever the most prestigious postdoc/professorship is.  Most people need to do several postdocs before having a chance at an assistant professor spot, which means several moves, which means either short term relationships or a partner who has a portable career (e.g. secretary, lab tech).  The only exception to that rule that I can think of is a pair of full professors, one of whom lives in the midwestern US and the other in Alberta.  They see each other a few times per year and are happy with that arrangement.

Well one of the cheapest **successful** satellite projects i know of was the British Black Arrow. And in the mid-late sixties that cost £~10m. However, consider that a lot of the ground work has already been done - not a lot of any space program's technology is actually classified and you could easily get hold of most of it, the rest of it you still could with the right contacts. Plus a lot of the materials will be more freely available for far less money, even with vast improvements, especially in terms of weight. When you factor in inflation i would hazard a wild guess that a program of that sort would cost probably around the same amount.

So your saying buying a crack pipe from 7-11 is exactly the same as having to go into a clinic full of people who spent most of there lives trying to cure drug addiction and having a positive experience?  You are also saying spending 60k on two days of treating some one with a blood infection from doing drugs with a shitty broken crack pipe all night is inherently better than potentially preventing 400,000 people from coming in and wasting more of my tax money.   Only retarded people who have never been outside in a city a day in their lives would think you can honestly make drug addiction go away by spending money.

They are an anachronism in cladistics, not in English.  It is often useful to talk about groups which aren't clades and English abounds with such terms (such as 'American').  Redefining all existing English terms isn't something cladists can do... and 'ape' was never a taxa so would never need redefinition. newlinechar  newlinechar As a point of fact, phylogenetics is not part of taxonomy... at least not yet.  Until birds are firmly entrenched as a subgroup of reptiles in the english language, cladists can't even begin to think about redefining the word 'ape'.

Hi camera! long time no see
evil people
I see where you are coming from. I (obviously) love discussion and debate. This 'attitude' in no way discourages discussion. Also, I cannot really comment on any systemic problems within the /r/movies subreddit, as I have not belonged to this particular community for very long. I am simply discussing the situation at hand. newlinechar  newlinechar I should have chosen my words more wisely. Pulp Fiction may in fact be inferior to many other movies (and in my opinion, it is). But, when coming up with a list of *favorite* movies, this doesn't matter. newlinechar  newlinechar If I were to say, 'the **best** movie of all time is Citizen Kane', this invites (or more accurately, requires) discussion and critical analysis. Some may agree, some may disagree. newlinechar  newlinechar If someone were to say, 'my favorite movie is Pulp Fiction (or Citizen Kane, or Fight Club, or Tree of Life, it doesn't really matter)', this is purely opinion. I might add to the discussion and reply, 'I don't like Pulp Fiction and I think Tarantino is overrated.' This, too, is a valid opinion, but it doesn't change the fact that his or her favorite movie is Pulp Fiction. newlinechar  newlinechar I cannot explain it any more clearly than I have already. A favorite movie cannot be wrong. A 'best' movie, however, can be wrong.
'Here's our plan, and here's our deadline' newlinechar  newlinechar The first person to say 'Well, that's a really bad idea' is generally the oldest. (All the twenty-somethings are having visions of allnighters, working weekends, and free pizza like it's a good thing)

I guess so.  The graphics and sound animations were great, and I liked shooting the guns, but it was just confusing and pointless.  I guess it's the whole 'everyone in the game wants to kill you and will rush (often suicidally) headlong at you to kill you' thing that really ruins it for me. newlinechar  newlinechar I was even trying to be clever once and sneak up on a roadblock.  I was crouching in the grass, moving up to get in a good sniper position when a car from nowhere runs me over.  He'd seen me from the road (somehow) and decided I needed killing.  It just doesn't make any sense. newlinechar  newlinechar So I said 'fuck the roads, I'm going to use the rivers.'  So I get a boat with a machine gun and head upriver.  Everything went fine until I came to a place with a dock and a bunch of bad guys (since everyone in the game is a bad guy, I didn't bother trying to see who they were).  So I go full throttle and let the boat coast while I get on the gun and shoot my way through.  All the way up the river I had my head on a swivel, making sure no one was behind me.  And no one was behind me until I started shooting and then *BAM*, an enemy boat with a machine gun and I'm dead instantly.  So not only does it make it very difficult by having everyone try to kill you, it piles bugs like this on top to boot. newlinechar  newlinechar I'm sorry, the game is just terrible.
That's exactly how it reads, like a tangent :P newlinechar  newlinechar So you definitely deserve that nickname (not always a bad thing!)  newlinechar  newlinechar I'm sure you'll get the hang of it ;)

How heavy are those nostalgia goggles? The Golden age of cartoons, if any, would probably be the days of the original Looney Tunes. Anyways, most of the 'Golden cartoons' people are referring to here hit their peaks in the early 2000's, newlinechar  newlinechar * Dexter's Lab: 1996-2003 newlinechar * Johnny Bravo: 1997-2004 newlinechar * Cow and Chicken: 1997-1999 newlinechar * Dragon Ball Z: Started on Cartoon Network in 1998 (much earlier in Japan though) newlinechar * Powerpuff Girls: 1998-2005 newlinechar * Ed Ed n Eddy: 1999-2009 newlinechar * Courage The Cowardly Dog: 1999-2002 newlinechar * Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends: 2004-2009 (Sometimes comes up as part of this group). newlinechar  newlinechar So only 1 cartoon ended before 2000. Check out CN now, it's actually really, really good. Better than it was just a few years ago (Nickelodeon has screwed itself with all the live-action though, iCarly is worth watching for Spencer).

This is not a behaviour exclusive to r/atheism, this is normal reddit behaviour.  Any given subreddit has its share of popular shitposts, unless it has very strict moderation.  This is just cos anything on the front page is generally stuff that appeals to the lowest common denominator.

I'm not mad, it's New Year's Eve. And also, those aren't beliefs that you mentioned, they are restrictions. People don't do some things because of their personal morals, religious or non-religious.

I don't necessarily disagree that getting a nuke is a good idea for Iran (though obviously if the US, Saudi Arabia, UAE, or any other country decides to invade it will be proven to have been folly), it's just a *terrible*, *heinously risky* thing for the rest of the world.  As for your arguments: newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;the US invasion and occupation of Iraq was a WMD - it killed tens of thousands. newlinechar  newlinechar Hundreds of thousands, actually.  But the deadliness of the US military does not invalidate the deadliness of nuclear weapons.  Furthermore, US military action is extremely unlikely to ever actually destroy all civilization as we know it.  Nuclear weapons being used by Iran, or any of the terrorist organizations it supports, could easily do so.   newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;In addition there is an argument that nuclear arms have led to an age of stability, with proxy wars replacing war between great powers. newlinechar  newlinechar A belief negated by the Cuban Missile Crisis.  If two of the most powerful nations on Earth - both literally with the brightest minds we could muster consulting them - nearly triggered nuclear holocaust, I shudder to think what any nation without those resources would do.  Most of the Iranian government would probably prefer to avoid using nuclear weapons offensively.  But what of the individuals who do?  And which of those individuals may have the ability to give those weapons to others?  And how many of them have ties to anti-Saudi or anti-Israeli groups? newlinechar  newlinechar Even if we accept that it was nuclear weapons that created the stability, I contend that this stability is still quite tenuous.  MAD only works if the balance of power is relatively equal, and all sides fear destruction.  We have already established that Hezbollah members, at least, do not fear death whatsoever.  What, then, would happen if they 'accidentally' come to possess nuclear bombs?  And if they did, how would they use them?  Even if they didn't, the mere *threat* of using them would irrevocably destroy relations between the nations of the mid-east.
I disagree with you, but also don't even feel like arguing about it.

That's a bit naive I think. First let's face the facts -- Iran is going to pay a huge economic price for acquiring a nuclear weapon. The US/EU are already on the brink of icing out the Iranian central bank. This means Iran will lose access to at least 2 of the top 5 economies in the world and probably more. The United States will pushing all of its allies to ice out Iran. It will be incredibly damaging to the Iranian economy. Second let's face the reality of what happens if Iran has nuclear weapons. They can never actually use them without committing suicide. All it will do is require Iran's neighbors and enemies to engage in a vast military build-up. So you're saying you think it's a good idea but the only outcomes are clearly terrible for the Iranian people and the region in general. I don't think it's a very good idea. It only benefits the leadership/government/military of Iran. It's an incredibly selfish act by people who have violently put down protests, rigged elections, supported terrorist groups, and instituted oppressive religions extremism on the population. I have no clue how anyone can really support these people making a selfish choice that does harm to basically everyone else.  newlinechar  newlinechar

I was never talking about Shiner as one of the small guys, though I can see how it could have been interpreted that way from the conversation I was replying to. But yes, I agree... when it comes to the bigger craft beer companies, Shiner, Sam Adams, and New Belgium are probably the best. As for the smaller breweries... well, I can't just pin down one. It really just depends on what you consider to be 'small' and 'large'. I'd consider Sam Adams, Shiner, and brewers like New Belgium to be about in the same league as each other(craft), but definitely not in the league of Anheuser-Busch, who has a bigger market than the other three can even touch. newlinechar  newlinechar But, for a true 'small guy', you have to find the micro-brews... but you can't get that stuff at a bar, unless you go to THEIR bar... so those don't really pertain to the discussion. newlinechar  newlinechar I'm happy as hell any time I can get New Belgium beers on tap/bottle at a pool hall or something, who generally don't carry a huge variety...

Again, spitting is helpful for moderation but where it is most beneficial is in evaluating the finish of the wine. This is because the actual act of spitting draws in air and stimulates a lot of those volatile compounds in the wine.  This, coupled with the coating of your mouth as you expectorate, allows for a lot of the more subtle nuisances of the wine to linger versus being overwhelmed by the alcohol as you swallow. newlinechar  newlinechar You should try it the next time your tasting.

&gt; I don't know Lisp, but was under the impression it... newlinechar  newlinechar (*sigh*) newlinechar  newlinechar I would say that's one of the attributes that's up for debate.  I think Lisp probably meets that requirement, but I can see how reasonable people would disagree. newlinechar  newlinechar I don't know that I've heard a consensus on exactly what 'strongly typed' means.  Wikipedia [lists](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong_typing#Meanings_in_computer_literature) no fewer than 11 'meanings in computer literature' of what it has been used to mean.  I'd say that Common Lisp definitely has some of these, probably lacks a couple, and is up in the air on others.  Wikipedia does say that Lisp is considered strongly typed 'in the sense that typing errors are prevented at runtime'. newlinechar  newlinechar As for generic programming, again, I would say that Lisp supports that.  Then again, the term 'generic programming' was coined in the early 1980's for the specific features and style of Ada, so a literal interpretation might not accept Lisp here.  (It's a bit like asking: does the lambda calculus support garbage collection?  Alonzo Church wouldn't have called it that, but I don't think it's quite true to say it doesn't, either.) newlinechar  newlinechar If somebody lists some well-defined criteria, and we can tell you if a particular language supports them.

I am a college Sophomore studying Music Education. At this point, I have already taught at four different high schools as a drumline tech/instructor, taught private lessons to a handful of students, work at a music store where I will also be heavily expanding on lessons, performed with quite a few school ensembles including a big band, concert band, marching band, pep band, jazz combo, Dixieland combo, orchestra, competitive indoor drumline, couple of garage bands, and as a solo artist.  newlinechar  newlinechar I won't say everything is the way I've wanted. For example, I basically blew up on a pretty easy mallet percussion piece in front of my college professors, blew up a car I was using to get to a high level indoor line (so I couldn't do the commute anymore), and recently received my first D in one of my classes (spanish). However, I will be brushing these problems off and fixing the issues as well because that is what I do. I think I have a real good start and am just going to keep going because that is what I do.

After a long journey throught the mystical lands of the interwebs, I have documented the various types of trolls. The XBL trolls are ten y/o kids with extremely high voices, keep your mothers on lock when dealing with these trolls, because they are especially great at sneaking into your home and having sex with them. The league of legends troll is a more silent breed of troll, they don't need to talk, as their actions speak for themselves. The league of legends trolls are very docile creeatures, they only troll when they are provoked, however easy it may be. You might steal their role, and then BAM! You've been trolled. The forum troll is a very complicated troll, as they are very diverse. But in my findings I have noticed that they will often state the complete obvious, and act like they were new. These trolls are the most harmless, as they don't fuck your mother or ruin your ELO.

&gt;The speed a plane travels is too fast for the system to transfer services between cell-phone towers. newlinechar  newlinechar Actually, this is close to the main reason. The problem is that millions of people fly every day, long distances. If they all had working phones, those phones would just keep switching between towers along the way. This would put a very big load on the system and could slow down its operations. That's the main reason why everyone is asked to turn off the phone. newlinechar  newlinechar To answer OP's question, satellites have nothing to do with this. Our phones do not connect to the satellites. newlinechar  newlinechar Another issue is that phones are distracting, so they pose a risk during the crucial moments of flight, i.e. the take off and landing.

This has been my impression from the bits and pieces I've picked up, and you posted the words and elaborated. Thank you so much for the link etc! newlinechar  newlinechar Romney or Hunstman would be the Republican's best shot of actually winning in 2012, I think. Win the moderate voters, win the election, and those two are the only ones that have a decent enough chance of possibly winning the moderate/undecided vote. Only problem is Romney is Mormon and Hunstman just doesn't seem to have what it takes (or has been written off by the media, i don't know much about him). 
It ebbs and wanes, so it will be bad for a period of time then will relax a bit then come back, etc.  And there's no way to predict the length of a flare-up:  a day or two, a week, months, etc.  And when it's bad, it's really bad - for me, prior to surgery, I couldn't wear sweatpants at since the elastic put pressure on my inflammation.  But it's managable, and so you should do two things to manage it: newlinechar  newlinechar First, find a good gastroenterologist that's ccfa affiliated (see my lnk above).  There are lots of meds (immunosuppressants, antiinflammatories, steroids (for short periods)) to help manage it. newlinechar  newlinechar Second, keep a food diary - write down what you eat, when you eat it, how much you eat, how often you go to the restroom and your 'consistency' (are you runny, soft, constipated, etc.).  Look for patterns between how you feel and what and when you eat to find problem foods and eliminate them from your diet.  newlinechar  newlinechar With a diminshed appetite, you might find foods like 'Ensure' that are calorie dense and liquidy to be good alternative for you instead of a 'normal' diet.   newlinechar  newlinechar But you need to face the fact that Crohn's is chronic illness - anything you do will only manage it, not eliminate it - even surgical removal of some of your intestines.  Having a chronic illness sucks... 8( newlinechar  newlinechar You really need support right now, so talk to your family (and friends that will listen) and find a good doctor to help you out.

Being rather romantic, I would somewhat rephrase this, although principally I agree. Sacrificing something big for a person is a great risk, psychologically, because it a kind of poisons the relationship. One feels pity, another one feels obliged, then the first one feels that the second one doesn't feel obliged enough, and so both start to quarrel... Only a really good and stable relationship could handle this. I think. Don't ruin your job for your unstable relationship, but also don't ruin your relationship by ruining your job =) That's like the most weird way of doing it! newlinechar  newlinechar So, really, I would try to find a synergy. Shoot for a good position in a good area in a hope that this whole situation will resolve properly somehow in its due time. After all, a year is just a glimpse of time, and the job market is so unstable these days - I feel like it's almost impossible to plan too much for the future =)

Well, actually, there's a federal tax (GST = Goods and Services Tax) of 5%.  Then each province (except Alberta) has/had a provincial tax, which in many provinces is 'harmonized' with the federal GST (i.e. it covers all the same stuff).  So in BC, there's a 7% tax, so the total HST is 12% in BC.  Alberta has no provincial tax, so you just pay the 5% GST; same in the territories, who aren't allowed to charge a territorial sales tax.

Ah, well quite true you are, sir. I still think it's unfair to tell people they should unsubscribe, just for stating that they don't like some of the stuff on the subreddit. Given, that most of it is just recycled arguments posted over and over again.

As a Liverpool fan, if Evra's story is accurate, 8 games is a very mild punishment. newlinechar  newlinechar This document however, does not prove anything to me. It especially bothers me that none of Evra's United colleagues saw or heard anything on the field. In particular, David DeGea who is Spanish, should be a key witness. [He was RIGHT THERE when the goalmouth incident happened](http://i.imgur.com/4ZwBy.png) newlinechar  newlinechar Further, Evra does not come off as someone who has just been subjected to racial abuse when the Referee calls them over. In fact he has [a bit of a smirk on his face](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/32131968/offended.jpg).  newlinechar  newlinechar He claims that he told the referee at that point, but the referee does not remember what he said (section 103). Now, if you were a referee and a player told you another player called him a ni**er, would you not remember? And if you were Evra, would you not make sure you said it again if it seemed like the referee didn't respond to the bombshell you just dropped? Especially since you've been calling for having players booked throughout the game? newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Judging by the publicly available footage, his face doesn't change expression until after they are walking away from the referee the second time, after the hand on head incident. This is when Suarez has admitted to using the word 'negro' and Evra clearly has a look of disgust just before Suarez breaks away for the ball. newlinechar  newlinechar I really wish someone had called the police and make it a criminal case like the Terry case. In criminal case, there's not a chance Suarez would be found guilty based on the evidence produced. After that, it's would be terribly hard for FA to come up with a guilty verdict. I wouldn't be surprised if the courts finds reasonable doubt that John Terry said 'blind cunt' instead of 'black cunt' and finds him not guilty. Let's see what happens to his case then.  newlinechar  newlinechar Ironically, it's perfectly all right to call someone a cunt, apparently, only when it's 'black cunt' does it  become offensive.

Yes. It's one thing if there is no active consent -- I've been in the position where the other party hit 'pass out' drunk, and that means *stop* -- no question. newlinechar  newlinechar However, if the other party is actively, clearly providing consent -- and especially if you're both equally drunk -- then there's quite a gray area here, and it's *not* so clear. If you both are clearly saying 'yes', and you regret that decision later, that's poor decision making -- nobody was taking advantage of anyone else, and poor decision making is par for the course when drunk. newlinechar  newlinechar If being drunk absolved you of responsibility for the decisions you make while drinking, we'd have a perfect defense for DUI charges: it wasn't my choice to drive, your honor, I was drunk. newlinechar  newlinechar Lastly, I want to make clear that the above is entirely predicated on the notion of an active decision on behalf of both parties.

Evolution and the nazi idea of eugenics have nothing in common. newlinechar  newlinechar Evolution states that humans all stem from an early common ancestor which then branched out in a myriad of different ways to form the existing races. newlinechar  newlinechar The nazis believed that mankind was created exactly as is by God x years ago with each race being separate and distinct from the others, and that over time through interbreeding the races were becoming homogenized. Their goal was to preserve the 'master race' of white aryans which they felt was being corrupted by the blood of impure 'sub-human' races like the jews and blacks (note: that's not just a euphemism; the nazis actually believed that all races save for white aryans were a sub category of humans). newlinechar  newlinechar Basically, the nazis had evolution completely bass ackwards.

i'm kind of in the same boat. if i'm at a used records store and i see something that looks interesting for a couple of bucks, i'll take the risk and buy it. but unfortunately i don't make enough money to gamble $15-20 on an album when there's something like a 95% chance that i'll hate it. 
Are you interested in assistance with anything, or are you ok as is?
Nonsense. Our Omicronian Porn Overlords have gifted us with 'pleasures that are out of this world', and I for one am grateful to fap under their rule.
Exactly. Furthermore being revolutionary doesn't suddenly justify whoring out your brand too much. Too much is too much, no matter the brand. 
I know a girl whose dad is sorta rich, he prob doesn't have the money your family has but he's not hurting. I dated her for a while and this was back in the 90's. She had a car phone, yeah that's what they were called back then... I recalled her saying it was like $2 a minute or something...  newlinechar  newlinechar Also, her dad topped her checking account off to 20k a month. And paid all her expenses, college, car, gas, etc..etc. Really no idea what she had to spend money on, but hey, she always paid for the booze when she threw big ass parties...

Paladin AoE tanking was one of the first steps in the eventual dumbing down of the game. newlinechar  newlinechar People discovered that paladins could AoE tank.  Soon, it became necessary to give AoE abilities to all of the tanks.  However, the devs couldn't balance around that assumption. newlinechar  newlinechar Fast forward to Wrath heroics.  Every tank class can AoE tank, so all heroics became group-em-up-and-burn-em-down nonsense.  Players forgot how to use CC.  Hunters stopped using traps, mages stopped sheeping, etc... newlinechar  newlinechar Now, in Cata, that's the expectation of the players, even when CC could make it easier.

We see a lot of hysteria over the Iranian bomb, which we don't hear when it comes to Korea or Pakistan. Iran has not invaded or launched attacks as those states have, and there is an argument that a nuclear weapon will actually reduce tensions, as the US hawks will back off and  the paranoia within Iran will diminish. newlinechar  newlinechar I mention the Iraq casualties as they are the fatal consequence of a supposed anti-wmd programme. One that was supposed to safeguard livesm not cost them, and that's ignoring the thousands of children who died because of sanctions. So if you want to stop Iranian nukes, you have to consider the real toll that will follow as a result. newlinechar  newlinechar Your last too paragraphs play up to the old cliches about Iran being a non-rational actor. It's a poor argument and can be directed at any enemy. Israel is Messanic and Bible driven and has the secret Sampson option, the Communist are atheists and therefore free of a moral framework or worries about divine justice in the afterlife, etc.

while that's interesting, this is what an actual [attorney](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Wittes) who understands the law is saying: newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; The final bill is, indeed, far less consequential than earlier versions would have been. Much of the fuss is overblown. That said, the bill has several important elements: newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;    The codification of detention authority in statute is a significant development, not because it enables anything that Congress had previously forbidden but because it puts the legislature squarely behind a set of policies on which it had always retained a kind of strategic ambiguity–a tolerance for detention without a clear endorsement of it of the sort that would make members accountable. Congress has now given that endorsement, and that is no small thing. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;    The transfer restrictions will continue to have negative effects on administration management of detainee affairs, reducing flexibility and agility and compelling the continued detention of people the administration does not want to detain, in a status the administration does not wish to use, and at a facility it would prefer to vacate. That this is no change from current law–indeed, that the NDAA offers slightly more flexibility than does current law–does not make these restrictions any less troublesome. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;    The rump mandatory detention provision remains a bit of a wild card that could have mischievous effects in practice. Though it ends up requiring very little, it does impose–as we have described–a default option of military detention for certain categories of cases. And this option might prove politically difficult to jettison. newlinechar  newlinechar   newlinechar &gt; Is there anything in the NDAA about which human rights groups and civil libertarians ought to be pleased? newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Yes, actually, there is.  Section 1024 of the bill, as we’ve noted, requires that people subject to long-term military detention in circumstances not already subject to habeas corpus review–think the Detention Facility in Parwan, Afghanistan–henceforth shall have the right to a military lawyer and a proceeding before a military judge in order to contest the government’s factual basis for believing them to be subject to detention.  This is an extraordinary and novel development.  Detainees in Afghanistan currently have access to the Detainee Review Board process, which as described in this article already provide a relatively robust screening mechanism, particularly compared to years past.  The DRB process does not include lawyers and judges, however, and human rights advocacy groups have criticized them on this ground.  Requiring lawyers and judges to staff out the screening process is a pretty remarkable shift in the direction of accomodating those concerns. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; What’s more, while human rights groups have decried the codification of detention authority, the codification does preclude certain interpretations of the AUMF that human rights groups hated. For example, while the difference between the D.C. Circuit’s embrace of the “purposefully and materially support” standard and the administration’s language seems pretty slight, the D.C. Circuit language did–which the NDAA now jettisons–keep critics up at night. And the D.C. Circuit famously flirted in one case with the notion that international law does not inform or limit detention authority under the AUMF–a position that the explicit references to the “law of war” in the NDAA seems to reject. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; In short, the bill is a mixed bag–almost no matter what vantage point one examines it from. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; This was written by Benjamin Wittes.

DoMA was a bad piece of legislation. And, yes, Paul should never have voted for it. It's one of the few moments when he went astray of his Libertarian principles. newlinechar  newlinechar In his defense, though, it was a different time. By the year 2012, gay rights activists won the culture war They successfully made their struggle a 'civil rights' issue. By doing so, they declared checkmate. Who, after all, can be against civil rights? newlinechar  newlinechar Before that successful ideological re-branding, gay marriage was seldom discussed in polite society. It was something--even up till the 1990s--seen as the domain of perverts and crackpots. newlinechar  newlinechar Young people now have no idea just how mainstream the gay rights movement has come. How tremendous its victory. Even adults in their 30s can remember when no politician (Republican, Democrat or otherwise) would openly discuss such things. It was considered shameful and not quite suitable for polite society. newlinechar  newlinechar Now it's career suicide to be *against* gay marriage. And all within the space of a decade and a half. newlinechar  newlinechar It's now the conventional wisdom. newlinechar  newlinechar It didn't used to be. newlinechar  newlinechar But young people now have no idea how it was. They think that they can jump in a time-machine and all the Democrats in 1992 would sound like the Democrats in 2012. They have no idea how radically the social landscape has changed. newlinechar  newlinechar This is not said to excuse Mr. Paul's hypocrisy. As a Libertarian, he should never have endorsed the government getting into the marriage business. Not now. Not ten years ago. Not ever. newlinechar  newlinechar It just goes to explain how, back when DoMA was crafted, the mainstream view was that marriage was an institution between one man and one woman. You could open dictionaries and read that as the definition. newlinechar  newlinechar So were dictionaries homophobic? newlinechar  newlinechar Of course not. newlinechar  newlinechar But now authors of dictionaries are rushing to expand the definitions . . . make them more vague, more elastic. And all precisely because the gay rights movement succeeded ideologically—and succeeded in a decisive way.

Now that you mention it, Howl's Moving Castle was never one of my favorites.  I mean, don't get me wrong, I absolutely *love* all of Miyazaki's films, but I prefer his early work.  I think Howl is similar to Spirited in that they're both more inwardly focused, but I think what I *like* about his early work is that they're more science-fiction, while Spirited, for example, is fantasy.  I'm big on science-fiction.  :P

Xavier has been given a similar 'origin' - his father was an atomic scientist - I believe the idea that mutants were the 'Children of the Atom' rather than just spontaneous was there from the start. newlinechar  newlinechar I am absolutely certain both Beast and Xavier must have been explicitly referred to as having an X-gene at some point, if only in the post-Decimation/Endangered Species stuff.

As a Target security veteran I thought people might like to know that this guy is incorrect. Target CHOOSES not to prosecute anyone over a certain dollar amount based on the situation. Why would I spend my time (about a 2 hour process on average) interviewing someone for 20$ when I could miss a potential 500$ arrest while I'm not available. That being said if I arrest you for 100$, not only does Target prosecute you for that 100$, but also for my time, and anyone else's time who was involved at any point during that arrest. The average arrest winds up costing the person 5k-7k$ regardless of how much they steal.

You completely misread what I said. With your logic, then would you be fine playing a mod where you brutally torture a poor malnourished child, as he screams and cries and you whip him in a corner, and make him eat his own feces? No you wouldn't because that is fucked up. You want to know why? Because your brain recognizes it and compares it to something you are familiar with; a child.  newlinechar  newlinechar Therefore, your brain recognizes that it is supposed to be a women, and it is being put in clothing that is considered objective by society. I'M NOT SAYING IT HAS FEELINGS, I'M NOT SAYING THAT THE MOD I DESCRIBED IS AKIN TO A FEMALE CLOTHES MOD, YOU FUCKING IDIOT. I was joking before, but know I believe that you are stupid. All I was saying was that your brain recognizes the shapes and compares it to a person.

More accessibility &gt; more people playing &gt; more popular &gt; more relevant to pop culture. newlinechar  newlinechar It's not that surprising really.  newlinechar  newlinechar Look at Pokemon.

It's an impossible thing to prove because it cant be replicated. The closest we can do is compare similar scenarios. For instance We know [IQ tests can be biased against other cultures](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-2389.2006.00346.x/abstract;jsessionid=232EBDD3C8F29EE5D185183E6B5DC525.d03t03), and they can be biased against people within our own culture who do not understand culture norms (like [autism](http://www.iser.com/resources/autism-iq.html)) it stands to reason that this would hold true for others outside our culture, like Lincoln. newlinechar  newlinechar Of course, without going back in time, this can *only* be conjecture.

Of course a specific demographic is part of the general welfare. If 1/3 of the gay male population dies of HIV (which happened), that has a social cost for everyone -- families, friends, businesses, whole cities and the country at large is affected by that. The fact that HIV can spread (and is spreading) into the general population is a threat to the general welfare, necessitating coordinated efforts to eradicate it.

Hmmm newlinechar  newlinechar But you're not entitled to be in a relationship with your SO, either.  Doesn't your SO have the right to decide under what circumstances they'll be in a relationship with you?   newlinechar  newlinechar If you consent to sex with your partner because you worry s/he'll leave you if you don't satisfy them, can you really say that your partner is guilty of raping you?  Your partner can break up with you for any reason they wish, after all.  Unless you think that someone should be forced to maintain a relationship lest it cause 'psychological harm' to their partner.  Which I don't think you believe. newlinechar  newlinechar I think sex can be negotiated within a relationship.  If one person says: 'I have a high libido and must have sex at least twice a week in order to be happy,' I don't think this unduly coerces their partner to do anything.  That person's partner can either accept the terms of the relationship, or they are free to find another relationship elsewhere.  I don't believe relationships should be compulsory, or that someone should just accept a sex life that doesn't fulfill their needs. newlinechar  newlinechar If you aren't happy with your sex life, I think you should be free to find a partner who's a better match.

The theoretical and (varying by practical implementation) flaw here is the assumption that a program (let's say a C program) has to have a stack or is anyway bound by a stack implementation.    newlinechar     newlinechar By way of example you can allocate 500K pointer sized objects individually from the heap using malloc and chain them all together to linearly point at each other and ultimately at a char.    newlinechar You can then (compiler permitting) have the type pointer with type 'pointer to pointer to ....

Selling images at small commissions doesnt seem worth it, and to cheapen an image by a first sale, sets prescedence for future sales. newlinechar  newlinechar I also just had a thought, theres the photography art market, i should add that to the list of lists.

I never had a problem with the comparison. I had a problem with the warrant-less insult and the praise of it.

A) Building up a new subreddit's population can take a looong time.

Depends on what you want to do.  In general, the anode (red) raises the resting membrane potential of the underlying cortex, making it 'easier' for those neurons to fire.  So, you can say that the anode helps to turn on the brain area under it.  The cathode does the opposite.  Note that the electrodes shouldn't actually be causing the neurons to fire, they're just making it easier (or harder) for those neurons to fire.  To give you an example, putting the anode over primary visual cortex (right above that bump on the back of your head, called the inion) is supposed to lower your contrast detection threshold, so that you can theoretically see things that would otherwise be too low contrast to see (see e.g. Antal, Nitche, &amp; Paulus, 2001).   newlinechar  newlinechar You can put the other electrode (the reference electrode) kind of anywhere you want, but it needs to be at least 8 centimeters from the active electrode or you'll just shunt current through the skin and it will really have no effect.  Also, extra-cephalic (not-on-the-head) reference electrodes can be good depending on what you want to do, just don't put it too close to the chest cavity to avoid cardiac effects: contralateral deltoid muscle is a popular extra-cephalic reference location.  This way, you don't end up inhibiting something else in the brain.  You can also use a larger sponge for the reference electrode, which will exponentially diminish the current density.  Also, sponges that don't have a lot of holes in them are better -- they create uniform current density and avoid hotspots, which can be uncomfortable or even cause scalp irritation. newlinechar  newlinechar So... if you want to mess with vision/contrast detection, put the active electrode on the back of your head, about 3cm above the inion.  If you want to mess with motion detection in the presence of noise, put it 3cm up and 5cm lateral (over V5/MT).  If you want to mess with working memory or problem solving, a frontal or even prefrontal location is more appropriate.  Many papers refer to the [international 10-20 EEG system](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/10-20_system_(EEG)) when reporting their electrode locations, so if you find a paper whose effects you want to replicate/try out, that's a good place to start.   newlinechar  newlinechar I'm seriously going to put this at the bottom of many of my posts, though: DON'T DO THIS UNLESS YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING!  :)

I'm not sure what you mean by 'hooded lids' - I do have a crease, however my crease does not hang over my lids nor is my crease particularly prominent. I have a very small lid space. One trick is make sure you are using a matte shadow in the crease. I very, very rarely use a shimmery shadow in the crease. In fact, in the sixth photo, I believe every single shadow I've used is matte. I use a MAC 217 brush and place the roundest end of the brush directly in my crease, and just use a sort of windshield wiper motion to deposit the color. I always use a very light amount of shadow on my brush and slowly build up the color. Also, make sure you are doing something with your brows. That can make a big difference in your ability to carry makeup on the eyes. I find that when you have perfectly groomed and filled in brows, very little looks 'too dramatic.'  newlinechar  newlinechar I hope I've answered your question, please let me know if there's anything else I can do to clarify.

Please understand that almost every single person in r/atheism is an 'agnostic' under your definition then, and not an atheist under your definition. newlinechar  newlinechar Instead they use a different set of definitions: newlinechar  newlinechar * Atheism is the lack of belief in God newlinechar  newlinechar * Agnostism is the lack of knowledge about God, and gnosticism is knowledge about God. newlinechar  newlinechar Under this, what you call atheist they would call a gnostic atheist.

Your structure is quite biased towards advertisers and against artists, considering the pretty widespread understanding that huge firms have more money than most individual artists.

I think a more interesting issue now is *how will the administration deal with this?*  It's a failure, an error. Dealing with it straight up is the right thing to do.  If they duck and evade, then it suggests dishonesty or a failure to recognize that this is a problem. newlinechar

Eh Carry is a term I really hate in this game. newlinechar  newlinechar Basically if you look at how much people get from items you could try classifying heroes there, I'm shite at explaining but I'll give a few examples of what I mean. newlinechar  newlinechar Lina(nuker) - If has great farm and many items, cannoy carry, she can support and use sheep sticks and Mek and all that sweetness but she has a limited damage output based upon her spells, she cannot get more damage from traditional items newlinechar  newlinechar Tinker(carry) - Has an Ultimate which allows him to 'reset' his cool downs, more mana = more resets = more spells = more damage. newlinechar  newlinechar The big difference between these 2 heroes is that Tinkers damage is only limited by his mana while Linas damage is limited by her cool downs. newlinechar  newlinechar Simple enough right? As far as Necrolyte goes the reason he's considered a 'semi-carry' is because 2 of his big damage dealing abilities are % based, this means that they scale the same all game, compared to say Lina whos damage output is Set, Necrolytes grows with the HP pool and like all % based abilities, his ultimate cannot be out tanked like Linas which has a damage cap. newlinechar  newlinechar To put it in simpler terms. newlinechar  newlinechar Nukers - People whos damage scales from ability levels and not items, generally meaning they can pull out big damage early newlinechar  newlinechar Carry - Heroes who scale well through items, meaning with farm = good, without farm = mediocre, generally heroes who don't have abilities that have set damage, such as Faceless having a dodge and stun passive and no damage from a spell. newlinechar  newlinechar Semi-Carry - Heroes who get decent damage from items but at the same time have spells/abilities that don't scale with items, Mirana is a good example of this, she has a Q which does set damage a stun and a speed boost, however unlike say Faceless void, her auto attacks gain no benefit from these abilities so late game her abilities become more redundant for their damage and she will be largely auto attacking. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Hopefully that clears some shit up but it's very late here and I am very tired.

I don't put those in the same category as so-called 'Reality' shows, though. Those are documentaries. newlinechar  newlinechar And there is a distinction. The way I see it, the purpose of a 'Reality' show is to create an artificial situation (e.g., a bunch of college kids living together in a house they could never afford, or a bunch of people stuck on an island, etc.), put regular people in that situation, and film their behavior. newlinechar  newlinechar The purpose of a documentary, however, is to go find something that is already happening in the world (crab fishermen doing their job, cops walking the beat, etc.) and try to document their activities in as unobtrusive a way as possible. newlinechar  newlinechar Of course, in a documentary it's obvious that there is no way to completely eliminate the possibility of any influence by the camera crews, but the goal is to keep that to an absolute minimum and *try* to show what things would be like if we weren't watching it. With a 'Reality' show, OTOH, the basic goal of the show's producers is to artificially manipulate the situation to create something interesting to watch. newlinechar  newlinechar Of course, it's very convenient that these categories happen to be defined so that shows I like (like *Deadliest Catch*) happen to be classified as 'Documentaries', whereas shows I hate (like *The Real World*, or *Survivor*) happen to be classified as 'Reality' shows. So I'm sure my biases are showing. But I still think it's a pretty good way of breaking it down.

It doesn't make them any direct money, but it does often reward the employees who work there and own stock/stock options, which in turn sets up a positive incentive structure.

This sets up a clear incentive structure for Amazon employees to work hard so that the products they put out are the very best =&gt; make the company more money =&gt;  cause investors to invest =&gt; drives up the stock price =&gt; more money for the employee.   newlinechar  newlinechar While I agree that my buying AMZN doesn't directly give the company money, it often helps create an incentive for the employees to keep doing what they're doing, and that's exactly what I want to do because I think that what they're doing is a fantastic service (mostly because I'm crazy lazy and hate malls).

If there's no evidence for a structure, then there is no use in depicting it.
Yeah, if like was like a sitcom, I'd be on board... I just don't know. Thank you, and best of luck!
I think a lot of what Image picks up is just what catches Eric Stephsnson's eye. I don't really read most of what they put out so I might not be the best gauge.  newlinechar  newlinechar I was always bad at pitching books. The only thing that's seemed to work for me is just making the books I want to and then showing them once I've got 15 or 20 pages done.  newlinechar  newlinechar What makes good stories seems pretty subjective. Personally I like comics to be fairly dense and hopefully not give the reader every answer. 
I'm glad. There used to be this giant fat guy named Brucie who ran his gumball machine business out of the building next door to where I worked. I guess he had a thing for my girl so I showed him a couple pics and he promised me free soda and gumballs for life. haha
It stopped at three percent :/
Ah, so instead of waiting to find out if the wording of a law is appropriate enough to proceed, we'll be waiting for a court decision after every bill to make sure that said bill is actually valid?

It's frustrating to see people keep bringing this up. Do you really not get it? Having the 'Destroyer's End' achievement with a date earlier than the nerf is a point of pride for many people. Even if you personally don't care, you can acknowledge that others do.

God will do whatever is in His will- and from an objective view point, it can definitely look like a dick move by God. If God is just going to do what he wants, why the heck are we here doing things? newlinechar  newlinechar God doesn't control us, though. We have free will.  You can clap your hands right now and that's your choice.  newlinechar  newlinechar God puts us through trials for a whole lot of reasons. He definitely wants us to grow. He wants us to understand that life is frail. If God just gave us what we wanted, like no pain and suffering- there would be no relationship with God, and we would not be able to love as much as we do. God would simply become our servant as we direct him to what we want. There is no growth, there is no relationship, there is no love. Only immediate desires met, which would make us the god instead of God the god (if that makes sense).

I was just about to post this lol. People like to be blind to the evolution of MMO's. They just expect that every feature will be perfect and it will be 100% filled with every single feature you could ever want.

Plus, there is only so much you can do to perfect something in a beta testing type environment.

Noooooo, EMDR is anything but an instant cure. I was actually SUPER skeptical of EMDR when I first read about it, and had pretty much resolved not to ever do it. But...desperate times, desperate measures, I guess. I've gotten to a point where I don't feel like I have the luxury of not trying a treatment that might work. That said, I HATE Francine Shapiro's model of EMDR, I am not a believer in the 'REM sleep' theory of why it works, I think it's ridiculous that Shapiro runs an 'official' certification school for EMDR...etc.  newlinechar  newlinechar Fortunately, my psychiatrist feels the same way - the EMDR he practices is... a variation? Instead of focusing on specific memories, he uses the treatment to focus on your perceptions, and then...deal with whatever memories come up in association with those perceptions? So, for instance, if you have the perception of 'I am disgusting', you focus on that and see what traumatic memories come up in association with that perception. And then you examine the memories, and come up with a more correct perception, like 'I was disgusted' - and then kind of...try to nail in the more correct perception? It is similar-but-different to the original method of EMDR, and I find it to be pretty damn effective. He still uses the eye movements, but my theory as to why they work is that they prevent dissociation while focusing on trauma memories (because following the finger with your eyes is grounding), and tax the brain just enough that it's harder to sit there and beat yourself up for what you're thinking (it quiets that voice in your head that is all 'STOP WHINING SISSY' or whatever).  newlinechar  newlinechar This treatment variation is clearly experimental (something I knew and accepted before I signed on for it), and imho EMDR (of any variety) should not be used as a first line treatment (because prolonged exposure is all-around better and safer, and works directly on memory desensitisation rather than perception).  But...yeah, EMDR is certainly not the 'one session and you're cured yay!' treatment that some quacks think it is. It's a long-haul type of thing that requires you to work your ass off - I have had 17 EMDR sessions already and I am nowhere near done. I despise the 'instant cure' line of thinking, because it makes patients feel bad or wrong for not getting instant benefit from the treatment.  newlinechar  newlinechar And thank you for your kind words. My heart goes out to your friend - I hope he recovers, soon. &lt;3

That's a great point that I hadn't really thought of.  I kind of thought of what they were saying as justifying what they thought of as faith.  If I were doing those things I wouldn't necessarily think myself earning a place in Heaven.  Also, I was under the impression that their use of 'in **your** name' showed that they were not doing it out of thought of their own merit.  However, both points are good ones and whatever they thought isn't the issue so much as Jesus' point.

Cards are tiny, I'm not super familiar with the game so long-pressing every card to see what they do takes forever and makes it nearly impossible make coherent decisions, stark contrast without any thought to theme or style drains my attention. Off the top of my head, from when I played it back in November. newlinechar  newlinechar For a better UI, Fortunes of War and Conado both do better jobs of displaying card-based information than Androminion: FoW puts all cards in the horizontally-scrollable system, and allows for zooming in while keeping all necessary details on the tiny version of the cards; Conado displays card details after a long-press, but uses the horizontally-scrolling hand mechanic, and also has a nice visual theme which may be sparse, but doesn't look hacked together in QBasic.

I too am an Atheist. I think religion is a good thing. And I agree its the crazies that screw it up. If firmly believe that without religion our world would be full of horrible people.

No it was amazing.  I made eye contact with her at a green market and she did that bashful smile and look away thing.

So I bought it and held it up to her with a facial expression like, 'Care to join me?'  She nodded her head, smiling again, and we went and sat down in the middle cafe tables.  Just as I started to wonder how we were going to drink it, she shouted 'oh!' and ran up into one of the buildings (I later learned she lived there) came down with a corkscrew and two glasses. newlinechar  newlinechar The next day I came out to the market again just hoping she'd be there.

Trust me - I could care less about the flashing; Just ask my friends when I'm skipping through the city in a kilt.  newlinechar  newlinechar The problem with kilt is when you're flashing people you are dumping every ounce of stored heat in the kilt.

Excuse me? Science is not based in a researchers attitude. Science it not based in the hopes and dreams of a child who thinks it would be nifty and funny to treat all his aliments by getting stoned.

You realize this is all about hats, right? I think fedoras are dumb. Nothing you say about acceptance, name calling or graduands assumptions about who I am will change that. The act of wearing a fedora and not being A) An FBI agent from 1962, B) Don Draper C) 75-90 years old or D) Baritone in a boy band in 1998 is ridiculous and, in my opinion, qualities of a loser. I don't care who you are. If you wear an ill-fitting suit and a fedora in my presence, even if you recycle, are best friends with Dave Grohl and regularly save children trapped in burning buses, my first opinion will be that you're a loser. Is it not human nature to form irrational opinions of others without knowing them? You've certainly done that with me! newlinechar  newlinechar I am not the person who, at some point in your life, excluded you from whatever it is that you were excluded from. Actually, I've never excluded anyone from anything and I don't see where I validated that kind of thinking. I live nextdoor to a group of guys who do their own thing. They're sociable, smart and seem to have a good time. My word choice of loser comes from the fact that they wear dumb hats. If given the opportunity, I'd be nothing but accommodating and friendly. There's a vast difference between a first impression and a lasting one and I did not feel the need to break that down in my comment because I didn't think I'd be dealing with over sensitive nutcases. newlinechar  newlinechar What you fail to realize is that I was being absurd.

I'm curious myself. 
I think religions absolutely need to stand up to scientific rigor. I loosened my beliefs when I started to consider how an alien might view religion. With far superior technology than ours, they would be able to do away with any erroneous myths, but would still be left with unanswerable questions. Basing belief off of a book (which is subject to interpretation and written by a human) always seems to be dangerous, but not all beliefs need to be based that way. A direct feeling or an intuition about what to do, or even a outright fantasy/hypothesis about how the universe is can constitute a valuable thought structure, in my opinion. All thoughts would be within the realm of this potential larger force, and since we don't all know obviously what the answer is, any wager someone makes about it, even if temporarily correct/valuable, is always subject to improvement. newlinechar  newlinechar Edit: I appreciate you reasonable and cordial reply. I was getting the same hostile vibe from your previous post, but I can recognize how your situation might be different. Where I live, everybody is pretty laid back about their beliefs, with more atheists than anything else, and the most vocal people are the atheists. If that was on it's head I could imagine that situation to be quite frustrating. In direct response to how you say religions in general are bad, I would say any rigid thought structure is bad. I think there are a good number of theists and atheists who use their thoughts to make the world a better place, but in almost equal numbers there are bad apples on both sides as well (have no idea really though).

You're right, I probably shouldn't have said 'Atheist ideals,' but regardless, those who don't understand exactly what Atheism is tend to make assumptions based on the things that contributors to r/atheism upvote to the front page. newlinechar  newlinechar It seems most of the people who strongly disagree with a sparse amount of the things posted in r/atheism simply unsubscribe, while those who voice their opinions against the *norm* tend to be downvoted and berated rather than justly debated. newlinechar  newlinechar This is obviously not always the case, but it does tend to happen quite a bit. Naturally, because of this, a lot of the stuff in r/atheism has very little opposition and therefore seems -- to an outside viewer -- to represent Atheists as a whole. newlinechar  newlinechar One can quote the ridiculousness in the Bible fairly easily, but retort, one can easily quote the ridiculous things that make it to the front page of r/atheism, which makes conversing or debating a believer on Reddit much more difficult.

You speak of the athleticism of Michael Jordan, but there are plenty of sportsman just as and more athletic than him.

Obama only has tangential power over what Congress does or does not spend time on.

However, the past decades have seen the domination of the 24 hour news cycle and more recently the emergence of blogs. Both of these have effectively neutered the efficacy of the pulpit, no one just watches presidential addresses if they watch at all. Instead people will read/watch analysis of anything the president says and generally they will choose analysis that fits pre-existing biases. newlinechar  newlinechar Add into that the extreme polarization of elected officials that we have been seeing. The impasse that we are talking about was all 42 republican senators standing in lockstep to prevent anything from happening unless they got their way. Further examples are plentiful, the sole purpose of elected republicans (aside from a few) these past 3 years has been obstructionism and propaganda. Anything Obama tries to do is stopped early and often, if it isn't then it is portrayed as evil, overreaches of the government. newlinechar  newlinechar Finally, coming from Chicago doesn't help his case. Since the start of his presidency he has been accused of playing 'Chicago politics' which is forcing and/or bribing people to support you. It doesn't fit with the type of president he is trying to be, but it has definitely stuck in much of the republican circles, using the bully pulpit fits right in with this attack on character. newlinechar  newlinechar Extra: Playing into people's conceptions of an 'Angry Black Man' is also never good for politics. newlinechar  newlinechar Essentially, you want a president who throws away all of his political capital on worthless symbolic gestures rather than works within the system that he is given to achieve moderate but still real, pragmatic change.

And for the Christians who believe in this interpretation of Hell, I guess that's a little more acceptable (even though it's still a form of punishment for not believing in something on faith, which obviously in my opinion is absurd). Unfortunately, the majority of Christians (especially in the US) know of Hell as eternal punishment of the worst kind imaginable. This is their belief and they believe that anyone who is not a Christian is worthy of this punishment, no matter what else they might have done during their lifetime. It's not a pretty image, and it's something that most Christians try to keep their minds far away from, but it's a basic fact of their faith.

Creating roadblocks to 'slow down' legislation just kills the ability of Congress to work on anything remotely contentious (and useful things are often contentious) and just enables them to work on things like SOPA and PIPA they feel have broad support*.

From their point of view it's a major American industry asking for laws to help combat piracy (which sounds bad!). Which is of course completely understandable. It's not Congress's job to understand the implications of the DNS system. That's constituents' jobs.

Yep. Use a matte in your crease and a shimmer on your lid. It will give your eyes a very countoured and defined look because shimmer reflects light and mattes soak it up. I think more people should use matte shadow. It just looks a lot more refined and modern than shimmer. That's been one of the largest changes in my makeup routine since I've started working at MAC - I've grown to love mattes and I use them much, much more often.

For the same reason it is in dota.  A support will be earning next to no gold in the game, even with multiple gp5 items you're basically just making enough to keep a few wards up.  25 gold is worth a hell of a lot more to a support than it is to a carry (difference between 0 and 1 cs compared to 200 and 201), and if your support is the one buying wards/counterwards they're going to be the ones who 25 gold matters to. newlinechar  newlinechar If you're in a dangerous place then just autoattack and let whoever kills it get the gold.  But if I do something like invest in an oracle, I'm pretty pissed off when other people 'steal' the last hit on a ward.  Full disclaimer, I play both carries and support and I always let the support take the ward gold if possible.

Allow me to school you. From [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias) page. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Confirmation bias (also called confirmatory bias, myside bias or verification bias) is a tendency of people to favor information that confirms their beliefs or hypotheses. newlinechar  newlinechar You're favoring the information that feeds upon your initial thought - that vegetarians/vegans are condescending and snide about eating habits. This is in line with confirmation bias. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;People display this bias when they gather or remember information selectively, or when they interpret it in a biased way.  newlinechar  newlinechar You ignore the information from the other vegetarians/vegans around you who aren't snide or condescending. You're being selective about which information to use. This is in line with confirmation bias. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;The effect is stronger for emotionally charged issues and for deeply entrenched beliefs.  newlinechar  newlinechar Yes, the issue of what to eat is very emotionally charged.

So we're just gonna sit on our asses and do nothing? I'm sorry, but this is just a ridiculous point of view. Inaction is probably the worst way to go about this.

Agreed. Is that really such a bad thing? The best players will get assimilated into the well funded teams (MC, Bomber, July, MKP, etc) and the rest are by no means excluded from participation in the GSL, and would likely be picked up by well-funded foreign teams (Dignitas, Complexity, Quantic, EG, TL, etc). This means higher quality GSLs, and higher quality foreign tournaments. It'll just make it insanely difficult to actually break into the scene though--as difficult as it is for foreigners to make it into the scene now, it'll be doubly difficult in the future.

Glad someone finally allowed the constitution of the united states to overrule religious oppression. I admit atheists in America aren't as oppressed as many groups in the world, but any amount of religious oppression of any group should not be tolerated in a first world country. But even more to my original point, the law may have changed, but very few people actually vote for atheists. Other polls say a majority of people in many parts of the US won't vote for atheists ever, simply because they are atheists. I vote for a christian every time I vote. In fact, I've never heard of an atheist not voting for someone because of their religious beliefs.

They apparently asked her to call me after whatever he did with the IP address I gave him didn't work, and she said 'Nope, I'm done with this.'

I don't see how. The tyranny of the majority doesn't need this bill. It would push through it's stuff regardless of if each bill had to be one subject or not. Today's compromise is a result of two things: 1) merging multiple topics into a single vote is 'easy' to explain to angry constituents ('Why did you vote for that Iraq war spending bill?' 'Well, you see, I was simply voting to increase the minimum wage for our poor.') and 2) the fact that the current push is 'to get things done' and 'bipartisanship' and 'reaching across the aisle'. The idea that one side would be able to run roughshod over the other side doesn't require this bill to happen.  newlinechar  newlinechar If anything, this rule would make it harder to pull off. Instead of simply tossing crumbs to the minority: 'I want to increase counterterrorism measures. Ok, I'll give you 0.1% budget increase.' and then pretending that it is 'bipartisan', they would have to actually deal with both bills separately.
Maybe that's the story.

I said Hahahaha! Last night I was in the supermarket, and lately I've been keen on getting down with a fat girl just for a change, but she's got to be a 'pretty' fat girl- pretty face, nice skin, takes care of herself etc... I saw this blonde girl who was a tiny bit too tall and too fat for exactly what I wanted, but otherwise perfect. So I'm eyeing her up thinking 'yeah girl, I'll roll all over you like a kid in a bouncy castle!' when she notices, looks me up and down, lingers on my crotch for a second, then rubs her face in what was a blatant display of her hand full of rings. newlinechar Wait, wedding rings go on the right middle finger right?

He doesn't have a source for any discussions about jesus. You can't trust that, and it doesn't stand up to historical scrutiny. I'm a grad student in History actually, so I'm pretty particular about this. If he had documents that were primary, yes I'd trust him on this. However, he's writing around the same time as the gospels were thought to have been written, so his source is most likely some form of gospel. Remember, the current form of the gospels to western christianity isn't the only one we have; we have hundreds of books from the same time period claiming to be written about jesus, with no copies from within 50 years of his supposed death. Further more, the Romans kept meticulous records, and there is no record in the roman documents regarding jesus for a very long time after the fact. There simply is not the evidence. You can't make the leap from tremendous documents written about jesus 100+ years after the fact to saying he actually existed. What there is evidence for, however, is a multitude of charlatans, mystics, and prophets during the period of roman rule. many of which said the same things jesus did. Something else we have evidence for? Nearly everything written about jesus in the modern gospels is predated by a multitude of religions ( Egyptian, European, Greek, roman, Persian, Babylonian, Judean). Almost every single thing you think is a fact about jesus is actually something that previous religions attributed to their own messiahs.  newlinechar

There's really no such thing as a true 'no-kill' shelter.

If an animal with severe illness (among other extreme circumstances), they will PTS. It's just the reality. If you've ever had a sick pet, you know the cost. It's not realistic to spend thousands of dollars on sick pets and then turn them over for $100, and that's assuming they can get well enough to be adopted out.

Terrapins and/or slider turtles only really eat live foods or prey normally when they are juveniles. Not to say they won't at all as adults, especially if they are starved or hungry.

To me the whole 'if you can't change it, don't worry about it' mentality doesn't do much.

You're better now, and stronger because you dealt with it. Sure you may have another panic attack someday, but just like the last time, you'll get through it.

Mainly political reasons. I don't know all the intricacies but thankfully this is ELI5 :). Basically there is unlikely to be any military intervention because both China and Russia have expressed strong opposition to the idea, any intervention will most likely have to be UN backed and both China and Russia have the power to veto any UN proposal. Not to mention Russia is good allies with Syria so they'll do their best to avoid any interference. Arab league don't really have the power or will to do their own intervention. I don't really know the 'real' reasons why NATO intervened in Libya but thats something you can google. So without any military intervention it's unlikely Syria will turn into another Libya although I don't know how it will end. Most likely a long drawn out conflict that may or may not result in the overthrow of Assad.

I hope I don't come off as a jerk here. I'm trying to be more polite on the internet. I'm going to try to cover your questions as asked. newlinechar  newlinechar First, it need not get to the point of use for the gun to have meaning. It's like how a strong poker hand helps you win a pot even if you never show it, or how the US has power due to owning nukes despite having never used one and not intending to if we can at all help it. newlinechar  newlinechar Rand is not against guns, she's against initiating violence (but not against fighting violence with violence). newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;So would there exist no police in an Ayn Rand fantasy world?? newlinechar  newlinechar There would likely be police. Though in a true 'fantasy world' everyone would agree with Rand and wouldn't take what they didn't earn or commit violence against someone else. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Or would there still be police, but without guns?? newlinechar  newlinechar There would presumably be police who only use guns against people who have initiated violence or theft against someone else. Rand believes you have a right to your own person and property that you earn through voluntary transactions. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Or would they have guns, but only point them at tax collecters?? newlinechar  newlinechar No. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;If I pointed a gun at your head, does the government have a right to point a gun at my head?? newlinechar  newlinechar Yes. Whether or not they have a right to shoot you for it is a more interesting question. I would consider a threat of that level to be violence. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Don't you need police to protect your private property?? newlinechar  newlinechar Not necessarily, but it's generally a pretty efficient method, yeah. eBay/PayPal is an example of a basically purely voluntary marketplace. While they involve police from time to time I'm sure, the bulk of their operation involves insurance and reputation. Thieves are generally shut out of the community rather than gone after with guns. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;If you do need police, how do you expect to pay them if your view of taxes as being comparable to murder is acknowledged by everyone, even the police who need to get paid somehow?? newlinechar  newlinechar You've completely eliminated the possibility of someone funding a police force out of their own free will. Whether or not people would be willing to do that is an interesting question, but to fail to even acknowledge the possibility is problematic.
You know, neither of these bothers me at all. They're doing their best by trying to use the word they believe to be correct. At least they're making an effort to speak more accurately.

If you're truly concerned about the budget deficit, you needn't worry too much about defense.  Defense spending has already been eclipsed by both Social Security, and by Medicare/Medicaid - AND those programs are growing, and they are not discretionary spending.

Not even.) newlinechar  newlinechar Editorial: People fight a lot about the government moving money from either rich to poor, or poor to rich, depending on their politics.

Standard size is 5x7cm, although for the reference electrode sometimes 5x10, 10x10, or other sizes are used.  Anything smaller than 5x7 is considered too small for the safety limits on humans.  They're synthetic sponge pockets, made of two .5cm-thick sponges stuck together, with a carbon electrode in the middle that attaches to the device via a pin on the end of a wire lead.  The sponges are quite dense, and have very small holes, not like the kind you can buy at the supermarket.  Before the carbon electrodes (little squares made of conducting rubber -- don't ask me how they work!) are inserted into the sponge pockets, the pockets are wetted with standard 0.9% saline solution to enhance conductivity.  Our saline is not sterile, because we're not using it internally, but it is made from distilled water so you don't get other junk in there that could corrode your electrodes.  The sponges are held to the head with non-conductive straps (made of rubber or plastic), as anything that gets wet will ultimately spread the current... this is why ace bandages are a Bad Idea.   newlinechar  newlinechar This video has been posted before, by me and others, but since this thread is getting some attention I'll put it here again: [Setup Video](http://www.jove.com/video/2744/electrode-positioning-and-montage-in-transcranial-direct-current-stimulation)

It's one thing to do 50 repetitions of shoulder presses but I consider the deadlift to be in a totally different league.

Plenty of counter tactics require too much coordination to be used in solo queue. Plenty of people may want to ban champs that would be their counters. People want to win, and bans exist to be used. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;I don't see why people ban things like ahri. newlinechar  newlinechar Her ult makes her very safe against both ganks and any opposing AP mid that relies on skillshots. Her ranges are long, making her a good mid against opposing AP mids that don't use skillshots. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Is it versitility or power that causes potency in this game? I never see brand banned, or veigar, even though they burst extremely hard.  newlinechar  newlinechar Neither. Popularity rules over bans in solo queue, which is indirectly influenced by power, and also by exposure from tournaments and pro streams. Since you have no idea who your opponents are outside of tournaments, you simply ban whoever is both likely to be picked and who you don't want to play against. Brand has cratered in popularity for whatever reason. Veigar is unlikely to be picked because he is incredibly squishy and relatively weak in lane. They would simply never be banned unless it was a targeted ban against a known Brand/Veigar pro on the opposite team.
That all sounds amazing, quite jealous.  newlinechar  newlinechar I might have to try to steal that idea, and see if there's any bowling alleys here that has good group rates.

That'd be a great thing to study.  All I have is my own flawed annecdotal experience.  Ever since I started using Steam I've been buying more games, and pirating far far less.

The first thing you should be looking for are Bombs- cards that are extremely powerful on their own and can single-handedly win you the game (think big flyers like Dragons or Angels or Planeswalkers), or creatures with a lot of great abilities (Olivia Voldaren), or very effective game enders (Devil's Play). newlinechar  newlinechar The second think to look for, if there are no bombs is removal, in particular good, low-drawback removal. Brimstone Volley, Slayer of the Wicked, Death's Caress come to mind. newlinechar  newlinechar Effecient Spells- Good equipment, draw spells, ect. Basically cards that give you card advantage, tempo advantage or two-for-ones. Most good Flashback spells fall here. newlinechar  newlinechar Aggro- Your creature base. You want cost-efficient beaters, preferably with evasion or a way to protect themselves. Gatstaf Shepherd and Stitched Drake are good examples. newlinechar  newlinechar Duds- Includes your 23rd card in drafts or things that don't make the cut. You don't want to make a deck that has a lot of duds in it. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar These are some good articles: newlinechar  newlinechar [http://www.essentialmagic.com/em2/Doc.aspx?hdocid=239](http://www.essentialmagic.com/em2/Doc.aspx?hdocid=239) newlinechar  newlinechar [http://www.starcitygames.com/magic/fundamentals/12549_Learning_How_To_Draft.html](http://www.starcitygames.com/magic/fundamentals/12549_Learning_How_To_Draft.html) newlinechar  newlinechar

If you are using a normal knife:  Sap, wait for engy to try to take off the sapper, stab him while he's turned around.  This is best done when all sentries have sappers on them.  When you actually do the stab, disguise or go invisible as quickly as possible right after (Don't disguise and then go invisible and try to get away though since your smoke will persist).   newlinechar  newlinechar If you are using YER and there are no other sentries looking at the nest you are looking at, it doesn't matter, but if there are other sentries involved you wanna sap everything first, go for a pick, rinse, repeat.  You won't need to escape and make multiple rounds the way you'll have to if you are using a normal knife.  This method is MUCH harder since you'll need to go for a pick (guaranteed pick if possible) before you go for the sentry nest.

Gotcha!
You forget through, that some of us are a bit younger than you. The last superbowl win and playoff appearance came in grade school/middle school for me. I barely remember it. I've been rooting for this team my entire life. This was the first time I had to really enjoy a playoff run, and even though it wasn't nearly as bad as in '91, it's still the most disappointing season I've been around for. It sucks, it really sucks. I have no idea how long it'll be until we get this deep in the playoffs again, and to be a few plays away from the big game sucks. 
It never fully goes away. There have been a couple of lulls of a year or so, mostly because of either becoming frustrated that my expectations weren't being met (by myself or the people I was playing with) or due to in-group creative or personality conflicts. I've realized that expectations will screw me over every time. It's far better to not fully visualize an outcome and let it occur organically. newlinechar  newlinechar I'm in a lull currently because my partner is pregnant with our second child and is not able to work so I had to take a pretty grueling full-time day job. The plan is to move to a smaller city once the baby arrives and purchase a home with a tenant unit to minimize housing costs and enable me to work less and make more music. 
Of course, that was the point of the original post. My point is that many who say they can't attend need to look critically at their lives and re-evaluate their priorities. They may find that they are simply unwilling to risk losing their relatively secure position in the world. Can't is an absolute term. Very, very few people actually *can't* attend. They are making a choice that what they would have to sacrifice to attend is more valuable than the movement. Virtually everyone who attends sacrifices *something*. Sometimes, those things really aren't worth sacrificing. I wouldn't quit my job in order to attend. I wouldn't deliberately get arrested if I had children to support. Everyone has to make these decisions for themselves.     newlinechar  newlinechar My main point is that the difference in actually attending and pressing the 'like button' is VAST. Someone who shares a link on facebook or up-votes a post on reddit and feels satisfied that they did all they could is very likely deluding themselves. Those people who really make an immense effort to publicize the movement and openly discuss it with critics are commendable, but we should make the distinction before glorifying armchair activists and contributing to their contentment. **TL;DR The iceberg should be mostly above water.**

Tocano is right, but laurencetribe has a point, but for a different reason.  The enforceability of the law is an issue here.  The onus is on the store owner to prove that the law is invalid.  Not everyone will have the resources to fight the issue in the courts.  Congress does pass laws that are later found to be invalid because they conflict with some provision of the constitution or other existing law.  That is bound to happen unintentionally AND intentionally considering the large number of lawmakers and laws that we have.  But at least there is some chance for the law to be struck down.

It's not like people woke up one day and consciously decided 'let's oppress women and pass a bunch of laws to do so'. Do you think that kind of top-down enforcement would have come into being if there wasn't general, decentralized societal pressure to make them so? newlinechar  newlinechar Were toys really ever that gender neutral? Boys had their blocks and toy cars and girls had dolls and doll-houses and if you look back even further boys were expected to go outside and get dirty in the woods while the girls were expected to stay in and play with their dolls. I think the color coding is merely a more modern display of the same kind of gender differences in play. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar I agree, an in-depth treatment of this would be very interesting.

I'll second all of this - juice is more comparable to soda than to fruit as far as health goes. In particular: newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Juice won't help you control your calorie intake. It's easy to consume a lot more than you think you are. Same reason soda screws people up so badly. newlinechar  newlinechar A thousand times, this. You may or may not be familiar with the Gallon Of Milk A Day (GOMAD) diet; it's a weight gain diet, entirely based on the premise that the body is terrible at gauging calories when they're in liquid form. To use a liquid diet to lose weight is entirely backwards. In fact, I'd recommend cutting out liquid calories almost entirely in favor of coffee, tea, water, and/or (sparingly) diet soda. You can drink juice or milk here and there if you want to, but they make it a lot harder to gauge how many calories you're actually getting. newlinechar  newlinechar You're probably eating far more calories than you think you are already. Buying a scale to weigh food and track calories is a little unsustainable (good luck doing that at any restaurant or even a friend's home) but a great way to get a good estimate of how much you're actually eating. A few tips on top of that: drink a large glass of water before meals, eat slowly and stop when you're full, and only eat when you're actually hungry (i.e. not at 6 PM every day just because that's when you usually eat).
i'd never really laughed out loud at a reddit post before until I read one of his first few comments.

Science isn't. How the results get interpreted are. FACT: the governments study on MDMA came out with errors designed to make it an easy decision to make it illegal. Not small errors, it made MDMA sound, literally 100x more dangerous than it actually is. I'm skewing this fact in my favor by saying 1/100th the results of that study are true. This is how studies work. Tobacco corporations have known this for decades. newlinechar  newlinechar As far as assuming it's possible, I'm telling you from experience, a single dose of MDMA cured PTSD for me. CURED. I haven't had a single flashback or psychosis episode since my first dose. It's rare for me to find drugs because of where I live and the people I know, but when MDMA comes around, I'm happy with life for a month after a single night. Don't tell me what I experience, I know better than you. I'm just asking that you accept what you hear is biased. newlinechar  newlinechar Also, statistics test whether or not these claims are true. Cancer rates? through the roof for tobacco. Automobile accidents? Alcohol is involved more than not in fatalities. newlinechar  newlinechar There are people in this world that will take advantage of guns for their own personal gain. People take advantage of psychology for their own personal gain. Stocks, internet, just about anything, really, so what's the distinction there? I say let people do what they want to do, especially since it's not going to affect me in any way. If it does affect me, it's probably because we just think differently, not because morally one can be declared right or wrong. So, outlaw free thinking or legalize all things that don't directly harm someone.
Let me tell you a story. I was sitting on a bench with a couple friends on a friday night and this really fuckin drunk guy walks over and sits on the bench next to us. He was barely able to sit up and smelled of booze. He started to pass out and we thought nothing of it. newlinechar  newlinechar Then some lady comes by and asks if he's alright and we say yea we think so he's just drunk. She tries to wake him but can't, does the chest rub with no response, she calls 911 and it turns out the guy was also diabetic and going into a diabetic coma, he lived because someone called 911. if they hadn't he would have sat on that bench fell into a coma and would have died. newlinechar  newlinechar The main point is that someone passed out in their own vomit in a public restroom IS NOT NORMAL. IT'S NOT FUNNY. and you should call 911 in those circumstances. Even if he was simply passed out, it's better not to take that chance. You can either seek help for the person, or risk not doing anything having the person die, and carry that with you knowing you could have stopped it, if you just did the right thing. That's really not something you want on your mind, as it surely would stay there for a very long time.  newlinechar  newlinechar In my case, I learned this lesson with that experience.  newlinechar  newlinechar also one more thing, the guy could have possibly overdosed on another drug, as drug addicts are known to shoot up and do various other deadly drugs in public restrooms. Shit there are probably dozens of fatal health problems that could cause someone to pass out and throw up. Wise up son.

And I do have to wonder how much of that 3% do biologists constitute. newlinechar  newlinechar By the way, the majority of the discussion on evolution had in the scientific arena are not about its varsity, but rather about the exact details of the mechanisms by which it occurs. The lively debate and search for evidence to support/debunk one's claims is just the scientific process in action.

I'm glad to hear you can afford to buy a game whenever you choose; I am not in the same situation. When they decide to release six big games all within the span of of two weeks, it kinda sucks figuring out which one (or maybe two you want). But then to buy the game and find out, 'There's 15 other items that aren't included because you didn't buy it three months in advance. But good news, you can spend an additional $10 to unlock all of that!' It's kind of annoying.  newlinechar  newlinechar When I buy a game, I want it in it's entirety, not stripped down.

New to Reddit. This is the President of DownsizeDC.org. One of the bills that inspired this legislation was a Port Security bill. The morning after the vote, we found out that Senate Majority Leader Frist added a prohibition on online gaming, targeted at poker players. Similarly, the Real ID Act, which had failed in the Senate, was added to an Emergency Troop Appropriation bill (that also included Tsunami relief). The law, which was supposed to take effect in 2008, is an unfunded mandate and is being resisted by roughly half of the states in this country. In both cases, legislators used a certain to pass bill to pass something the public clearly didn't want.

I think the community just needs to keep growing with its advice as to what is fashionable for different settings. Of course work wear and casual wear are going to be different. But the beauty of fashion is there are awesome options for every occasion. FFA is most likely never going to come to a universal style consensus, but that isn't a bad thing. What it does need to do is decide if it wants to actually be on the fashion end, rather than the 'I like this' end. Because the two are very different (which explains high school fashion fads).  newlinechar  newlinechar And luckily, it isn't as if this subreddit isn't trying to explore those options. Just in the WAYWT for this week, there is a wide variety of outfit types geared towards different occasions. You've got women exploring [work attire](http://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/p310v/waywt_jan_30th_february_5th/c3mmmyp) seeking advice, and you've got women going more [casual](http://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/p310v/waywt_jan_30th_february_5th/c3mhw07). newlinechar  newlinechar Until a guiding community voice builds, there will be a lot of missteps. FFA as a whole needs to recognize that it is still mostly the blind leading the blind, in the fact that this subreddit is found because women are looking for advice. So as long as people don't get upset when advice doesn't confirm their wants, and contributors present explanation and guidance in their critques, FFA will be able to stand and represent good FASHION as it applies to a variety of occasions, ages, and body types.

Judging from your coherent literacy I'm sure you realize how offensive crude generalizations are; therefore, I'm going to give you the benefit of the doubt and assume you are speaking out of ignorance rather than spite. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;How about trying on the whole 'leadership' thing that you were supposed to learn on the path to Eagle? You know, take a stand for what's right and don't back off of your convictions. newlinechar  newlinechar You seem to be misunderstanding the term 'leadership.' At its core, leadership has nothing to do with 'what's right' and 'convictions;' its about leading. A more relevant term you could have used is 'loyal,' which is one of the points of the Scout Law. This word, as you probably are aware, carries many of the connotations you seem to hold with leadership. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;You're a bigoted hypocrite who is too weak minded to speak out against something so blatant.  newlinechar  newlinechar Your indiscriminate use of hollow buzzwords aside, you seem to demonstrate the very vices you attribute to me. Tell me, what exactly did I say that implied bigotry or hypocrisy? To me, those words describe someone who's intolerance or prejudice rings through all that they do. From a single comment, you have labeled me as bigoted, hypocritical, and weak minded, all the while acting as though none of these things apply to you; *that*, to me, is hypocrisy. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;But hey, it's good to know that you think money &gt; doing the right thing. newlinechar  newlinechar This statement serves only to solidify the invalidation you impart upon yourself at the beginning of your comment; that is, your goal is not to make logical points, but rather to cause the most offense. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Very 'Eagle' of you.  newlinechar  newlinechar It's unfortunate that you have so little respect for individuals other than yourself; that you seem to feel the need to attack the character of strangers on the internet in order to validate your own beliefs. newlinechar  newlinechar I stand by what I said originally: Yes, the BSA has policies that are based on nothing but intolerance. But, unlike certain others, I have been able to focus on the positive aspects of the program, being leadership and character development. Your knowledge of this topic appears to be incredibly rudimentary and centered only on spite, but I would like to let you know that 'speaking out' against that which you disagree with is not always the best move: If I had fought the organization on every policy I disagreed with I wouldn't have been able to be a part of the beneficial side of the program in the way that I have been. newlinechar  newlinechar Lastly, out of curiosity, I would like to ask what *you* have done regarding this issue.

Yes, you can't. Better if I had said 8, each codeword + 7 hamming distance 1 words must decode to that codeword, so each set of 8 per codeword is disjoint, so that takes 8 words per codeword.

Ok great, you told me what you believe, you didn't tell me why you believe it. What evidence has based your belief? The Bible is not evidence. I assume you grew up in America. Do you really think it's a coincidence that you believe in the religion that is the most common in this area? Why aren't any of the other religions correct, but yours is? In your reply tell me what your religious views are(Christianity, Islam, etc), so I don't go making any assumptions further into the argument. newlinechar  newlinechar If you want to have a debate about your beliefs, then yes, you are obligated to defend them. newlinechar  newlinechar The reason I'm a condescending ass is because I fucking hate Abrahamic religions with a burning passion. If I could kill religion, I would do it without a second thought. I've read both the old and new testaments(this is actually why I became atheist), and the amount of violence, hate, and pain that Abrahamic religions have spread far outweighs any good effect they might have. How can you believe in God without evidence, is what I'm getting at. I want actual evidence. If you accept God without evidence, then you have no place arguing here, because that in itself is an irrational conclusion.
I can't defend a 30 hour tutorial, which is basically what you are saying they implemented, especially with a battle system that is markedly *less* complex than some of its predecessors.

Identify what classes you currently need, then get your autobattle on. Then you're tested on that (in an extremely scripted manner) over and over and over with 'more explosions', so to speak, at least until Chapter 11, which was there so Square could point to it and say 'See? See? This is still an RPG.'

I'm the only one up right now so I can't give you a definite answer but I do have some questions. These are from me as a user, not a mod. newlinechar  newlinechar Would that overwrite the emotes rendering the scripts/emotes useless? Or would we still get to use the script emotes, but everyone else would see the dummy post? I'm not sure what your answer here means. newlinechar  newlinechar You know that not all of the emotes come out of mlas1/mylittlewtf? Would every single sub-sub be covered, even the script only emotes?  newlinechar  newlinechar I can easily see *some people* taking this as a challenge and adding emotes/messing with the code and names of emotes to still make blank posts appear, can you guys keep up with that? Are you willing to?  newlinechar  newlinechar With about 5 global scripts floating around, plus the bot, it seems ridiculous that mod action is required for this at all. newlinechar  newlinechar &amp;nbsp; newlinechar  newlinechar As a Mod: newlinechar  newlinechar Wouldn't an easier solution for both sides be to keep the bot around and link the scripts in the side bar? None of the scripts come with nsfw material except for hom3r's NSFW script. I've been making sure of that. And if shipping is even a problem we can revive that old sub (andysfwemotes or something) and make sure the shipping tables are not included.

Its good that you are in a position to turn down work whenever the requirements demand support for older browsers. Wish I was in that position. newlinechar  newlinechar Seriously though, I find it difficult to imagine a workflow that doesn't require internet access.

Sometimes you do actually need to know browser quirks or see example code. Building a site without net access may not be crippling, but it would create serious inconvenience. newlinechar

You're correct that the ability to reproduce results is important to the scientific method.  The evidence before you of a substantial portion of the world's population believing in God should tell you that similar experiences to mine have been reproduced elsewhere and in other people's lives as well.  Unfortunately, and much to the chagrin of people who want scientific proof of the evidence of God, individual miracles are typically one-off's; they are not reproducible, and are not reproduced.  They'd probably lose more than a bit of their impact if they were.  As for having the same equipment, let he who has eyes see, and he who has ears hear. newlinechar  newlinechar My point was that you have not done the experiments yourself, and therefore regardless of the stated outcome of others' experiments, you are *personally* taking their results on faith.  Perhaps they're misrepresenting the facts, or perhaps they're misinterpreting the results .  You wouldn't know - you'd only have an opinion based on what another fallible human being chose to represent to you. newlinechar  newlinechar The thing is, you're right.  If I haven't been to Africa, I *can't* know that it exists.  I can only assume that I've been told the truth about it by others who know.  My lack of willingness to accept that truth wouldn't suddenly make Africa non-existent, any more than your lack of willingness to accept what I've told you about the existence of God does He.  For what it's worth, after thinking about it for a bit, I can now claim to know for a fact that Africa does NOT exist.  Ridiculous?  I submit that Africa does not exist because 'Africa' is a notion borne of a human mind.  An idea about a particular part of the earth's crust; nothing more, nothing less.  It is a political, geologically relevant idea, but an idea nevertheless and therefore has no physical substance and does not in fact 'exist'.  Of course, most everyone you asked straight out would say that of course Africa exists, and give it no more thought.  Perhaps other ideas of man are worthy of similar consideration of the status of their 'existence'. newlinechar  newlinechar Our perceptions, validated by the scientific method or by whatever means bear credence for each of us, are in the end only our perceptions and each of us needs to come up with our own universal model.  Every One is the centre of their own universe.  For someone to say that another's universal model - whether that includes God or it doesn't - is incorrect, is the absolute pinnacle of arrogance, and at the risk of being offensive to you, shows a level of immaturity and ignorance that behoves the offender to remedy.  I wouldn't call it 'bigotry' exactly, just uninformed and ill advised.  You're clearly fond of science, so let me put it to you like this: Using the scientific method, prove God *doesn't* exist. newlinechar  newlinechar Of course, we both know that it can't be done.  We just have different ideas about why it can't be done. newlinechar  newlinechar And finally, I noticed you edited your ealier post and I've just read your Douglas Adams rant.  There's nothing about my religion that is sacrosanct from challenge.  I welcome you to challenge any aspect of my religion, and I would be happy to provide answers.  They may not be answers you (or for that matter other Christians) like, but give it your best shot if you want. newlinechar  newlinechar If not, I understand.  I'm pretty sure we're both starting to think of this exchange from a similar perspective.  Arguing with people on the internet always brings to mind an Andrew Dice Clay quote involving a cheese grater, '...mildly amusing, but mostly just painful'. newlinechar  newlinechar Cheers! newlinechar

My childfree reasons are largely environmental also, but the people who are looking for egg donors are going to get them from someone.

Not really convincing. There is no consensus among real historians that Jesus existed. The textual evidence is invalid if it's a religious (and therefore biased) text. The non-Jewish sources mention only Christians who say they follow christ, not exactly a convincing argument for his existence. Jewish sources are thought to be tainted by later scholars. I will grant that it is possible that jesus was a person whose deeds were exaggerated to a ridiculous extent, but barring further useful evidence, I'm putting him in the category of 'likely fictional.'

It's not about money.  It's about what you think of me and my job and how well I preformed it.  I serve in medium size town in Texas.  Low tips are normal and expected behavior for people here.  They tip based on what meal it is 1-2 dollars a person for lunch or 3-4 for dinner.  Typically well below the '15%' but that's the way these people were raised. newlinechar  newlinechar Not tipping means either that the service was abhorrent or you don't give a shit about me.  I jump through hoops to make sure people are happy: Giving them extra food, making special considerations, telling them how to save money, taking off food they didn't want/eat ect ect.  This is a part of the service I provide.  The restaurant pays me 2.13 an hour to bring food to your table.  The tip you provide is the service and how it's delivered.  When you decline to add a tip you tell me that me that my service was awful or that you don't think I deserve one (use the excuse that tipping isn't customary in other parts of the world then give me a tip based on the difference of minimum wage (7.25 -2.13 = 5.12) divided by the amount of time you sat at my table (in hours) and divided by the tables I was actively servicing then I will of at least made minimum wage equivalent at your table).  I serve tables as a living this isn't a side job I take while I am in school, this job pays my rent and feed my wife and cats and me.  I am 25 with a high school education and this is about the best I can do.  **I take great pride in my work** and consequently when someone stiffs me they in essence told me 'Fuck you'.

You are being intentionally dense. Exterminators work with bugs, all types. If someone was afraid of a certain type of bug they wouldn't be an exterminator. Retail job does not equate ladder work.

He called it a marketing strategy and it isn't - This forum loves to upvote people who have no idea what they are talking about. Like that guy. * That said, valve can do whatever they want with the ranked system because competitive counter-strike is scrimmaged and matched on private servers with the rules the leagues use (ESEA,CEVO). Having a ranked 'ladder' of sorts is cool but the competitive community gauges skill by league rankings, it will never be from any valve rank. They are actually listening and changing things according to how it needs to be done to appeal to the casual side and competitive side - there IS great hope for this game and I do not think the current state of the beta is a good way to gauge how cs;go will be.

I do it because the first recipe I found said to do it. I think the first time I did a roast it was in the oven so you brown the meat to help keep the juices in. AFAIK it doesn't hurt the quality of the roast in the crockpot.

I'm not talking about the homeless population that relates to those studies.  I am talking about chronic, serious mental illness that results in chronic homelessness.

I don't know if sociologists have a solid answer for this, but it's something I've been curious about as well. One of the reasons groups like Asians/Iranians have assimilated more effectively is because their culture emphasizes a lot of the same values. I feel like ghetto culture may have evolved partly as an attempt to 'distance' themselves from 'white culture,' which if true is a damn shame because in the end it just reinforces inequality because of the glorification of ignorance that you're talking about.

Great post. Thanks.
I agree, and wanted to add: Thanks for all your hard work, mods!
 We seem to disagree on what evolution *is*.  I assume we're both speaking of evolution by natural selection?  Because it's a blind process, and *takes advantage* of nothing, makes no goals, and gives *nothing*.  That would indicate there's a will behind the process, and there just isn't.  In fact, that's sort of the point.  For a quick demonstration, see this short video on the [laryngeal nerve](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cO1a1Ek-HD0). newlinechar  newlinechar I find it hilarious, though also monotonous, that theists argue *'love exists therefore God!'*.  The short answer is: No, love exists, but it lives in the realm of biological brains, and not just human brains, but also in chimps, dogs, whales, dolphins, and perhaps even crocodiles.  Just because science doesn't know everything about the brain, doesn't mean that the mystery that's left is going to somehow be God.  This claim has been going on for centuries, and **every** single time a given mystery has been unraveled (and there's been millions of mysteries solved by science), it has pointed away from God (or anything divine) and dead on to natural processes. newlinechar  newlinechar Do I think love is real?  Of course I do.  Can I be compelled to *love* something without knowing its attributes first?  I don't think I have that much raw dominance in my cranium to do that with my definition of love, which may be very different than  yours, for I have been married for 26 years (and counting) to the same wonderful woman.  I'm paralyzed from the waist down because of an accident that occurred two years after we were married (and had two kids), so she became a nurse and has taken care of me since then.  I won't bore you with all the details, but suffice it to say we've been through some horrific medically related things together, and I wouldn't have had a remote change of making it this long if she hadn't been there for me.  Love isn't who you'd fuck or who you wouldn't, love means so much more that I doubt most young people can possibly know what it is, yet you throw it around like some kind of cheap aphrodisiac.   newlinechar  newlinechar You can think of me what you wish, because what you think about me matters not.  What matters is that my kids have grown up (they survived), are wonderful, responsible, free-thinking people who help others almost to a fault.  They love me and their mother (I can tell because they like to spend time with us, as do their spouses), and have a good circle of friends.  Most of our kids' friends are our friends, and vise-versa.  A few years ago their friends and I started a non-profit org that benefits homeless people.  Though I have chronic nerve pain, several herniated disks and chronic kidney stones which require surgical procedures every 4 months to clear, I enjoy life to an extent only free-thinkers can understand.  I'm a student of this universe in a state of perpetual awe at what science reveals.  Just in my lifetime the advancements we've made have been astonishing.  I remember when I first saw a microwave, tv remote control, Sony Walkman, re-usable space shuttle, VCR, Internet, TiVo, 60' 3D HDTV with 1080p, Skyrim, Reddit, etc.   newlinechar  newlinechar Sure, I've done things in my life that I regret, but I also own them and take responsibility for them. And, there was a time when I gladly handed them off to a certain Nazarene already being tortured on a cross, or an almighty father in the sky. Then someone smarter than me pointed out that what I was really doing was scapegoating to make myself feel better, which in my opinion, is morally wrong.  So I stopped.  If free will exists then we each are responsible for our own actions.  One should act accordingly.  If we're right, and there's nothing conscious left after the destruction of the mind, then it's important that we pay close attention to the details in this life, and try to leave this amazing place better off than how we found it. newlinechar  newlinechar I hope this answers your question. newlinechar  newlinechar (edited for grammar and clarity)
Depends on your taste but it's a pretty good drama.  8.0 out of 10 rating on imdb.  It's called Parenthood(http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1416765/) Stars Peter Krause, Lauren Graham, Dax and Erika Christensen as four siblings, each with different family situations they are dealing with.
That one was similar, but not the same. In the video it was a guy who died in a car accident, but tragically wasn't Glenn Beck.

Sona is def my most played, and a couple of things to keep in mind about her. newlinechar A) Know which chord to use. People trying to run away? Slap dat purple chord on them. Jungler trying to close a gap to get off a gank? Purple chord that invader. You commit to a fight where neither side is backing down? Green chord dat hoe. Green chord is stupidly overpowered for early exchanges. Just want to be generally annoying and chunk people for all their life? Start chargin up dat blue chord. newlinechar  newlinechar B) Don't be afraid. If you are in a bad position to get off a good ultimate, use that flash. If you end up dieing because you stunned all five of them, who cares. Give your team that chance to wail on them for 2 seconds without any counter. Also, your ult is on a pretty short cd, even early. Don't be afraid to just use it to catch that graves that just went in for a cs and mispositioned himself. However, if you think the jungler is nearby or have no idea where he is, save it for the gank. Be wise with your ult, but don't be hesitant to use it. newlinechar  newlinechar 3) Dealing with bad lane partners....this is tricky. Try to communicate with them, let them know you think they are being a little too risky. Also, you might be unintentionally baiting your AD back into fights without meaning too. If you aren't confident i your AD's ability to make good judgement calls, when you disengage from a fight make SURE you disengage from the fight. Don't look back, don't hit q one more time, just gtfo. Most AD's will follow their support. If he still continues to make bad choices in life, get your jungler and mid to come down and gang bang your lane before they can gangbang you. Your AD can't suicide to a lane that is already dead. Just stress to your AD that while he should harass, his ultimate goal is to farm. I've even just gone the 'I'll stand in front and harass them, you just last hit minions' rt before. Very easy to do with sona/ proper bush control. newlinechar  newlinechar Hope all this has helped :) Hope to see you soon on The Fields Of Justice!
I've talked to my SO a bit about it in the past, and he's agreed to back me up if I defend myself against her, but he also can't bring himself to talk to her about something he hasn't seen her do to me directly, since for him its all second hand information. newlinechar 
Rhodesian Ridgebacks are beautiful dogs.  And while they were bred for hunting, their quarry have traditionally been African Lions and baboons.   newlinechar  newlinechar That said, they have hunting in their blood, and I've heard of rottweilers, dobermans, and plain ole' mutts hunting birds (which is what it sounds like you want) if someone takes the time to teach them. newlinechar  newlinechar (I'll add that IL has excellent waterfowl hunting, especially Canada geese). newlinechar  newlinechar I'd be a touch concerned that a dog bred for hunting on the African Savannah won't have the fat and fur for hunting season in No Il (excepting this unusually warm year).  newlinechar  newlinechar Also, I have seen female ridgebacks over 50 lbs.

Sure... but just because Capitalism has (possibly) killed more people does not mean that Communism has not also killed millions and millions. Frankly any ideology that leads to the death of millions should be avoided like the plague. This is not a good argument for Communism at all.

With respect to Nickleback, you've really never seen [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qs4tNeGyTyI)? It's two of their songs played simultaneously, the intention is to demonstrate they recycle their music. Same chords, same breaks, same chorus, same beat...it's one of the oldest videos on the net, and is the reason for the popularity of  'Nickelback sucks' jokes 'round these parts. newlinechar  newlinechar My girlfriend brought it up because she was under the impression I was doing something similar with Skyrim/GW2. I assumed I could simply relate the comment and you would understand the reference, since you've been here a year. newlinechar  newlinechar As for the comments with respect to her playing both games...well, she played both games. Some people play more than one game. However, she hasn't been playing GW since she was 10, so I didn't want to go the whole mile and characterize her as a huge fan of both series. newlinechar  newlinechar But honestly, I have a really hard time buying that you couldn't figure that out on your own. Please stop being obtuse, and *try* to actually address what I was saying? I was trying really hard to actually have an exchange of ideas here with you, and I was sincerely hoping for some sort of explanation. newlinechar  newlinechar I'm giving you the credit of assuming you're actually more knowledgeable about music theory than I am on this one, so I'll ask again, context provided this time: Can you explain that? newlinechar  newlinechar If not, can you explain what you meant by 'IT DOESN'T SOUND THE SAME'? IE. Whether you were referring to a technical similarity I'm unaware of, or your opinion, or if you were making a declarative statement on something that's entirely subjective, or if you were *actually* saying the waveforms aren't similar enough to make a comparison?
I think looking forward this early will cause you to 'honeymoonize' things and maybe rush things once you're in a relationship with someone because you already have it ingrained in your mind that you're comfortable with marrying early. I'm not saying it's bad, back then in the USA the average marrying age was early 20s and my parents married at 25/27, respectively, but you're just committing too much to someone at an age where neither of you can support yourself on your own yet fully and independently (I'm going to love my parents until one of us dies first, they're amazing). I don't have a problem with other people getting married whenever, but if I'm getting married at 26 or an age that young, I have to wake up every day for at least a few years reinforcing the belief that out of all of the billions of women out there, she and she alone can make me happy and that I trust her enough to feel the same. Currently in high school I haven't been in a relationship in quite a while, so I'm wary of trusting anyone into my comfort zone because they might just walk over me and my heart.
North America has a fetish with accusing the rape victims of somehow 'asking' for it. Perhaps they were wearing clothing others deem promiscuous, or perhaps the victim was somehow sexually suggestive. People use both of these (and so much more!) to suggest that the victims could have avoided it, utterly ignoring the fact that *rape can happen to anyone, any time, anywhere, for any reason, and it's fucking disgusting*. newlinechar  newlinechar Just take a scan through the comments in this thread to see the anti-victim mentality at play.

A downvote like that should also be followed by a comment explaining why it was downvoted, like Bill_Hicks_Lives did, so I think that the downvote was justified and Bill_Hicks_Lives did nothing wrong.

Not every weapon shows kills. The only weapons that have the kill counter on them are 'Strange' weapons. To begin with, you should know there are three basic types of weapons: Normal (or Unique, if you'd rather call it that), which are the weapons you get from drops. Yellow names. Then you have Vintage, which have blue names and are weapons that were obtained before the Mann Co. update, I believe, and finally you have Strange Weapons. newlinechar  newlinechar Strange weapons have orange names and they are only obtained by opening Mann Co Crates with keys. Each crate has a different set of weapons you could get. So the only way Strange weapons are created is when someone uses a key on a crate and receives a weapon. Keys are about $2.50, or 2.44 refined, but you can often buy stranges for much, much cheaper by trading with other people. The cheapest stranges will sometimes go for as low as a reclaimed. In general, the rarer/newer the crate that contains the weapon you're looking for, the more a strange will go for. For example, Strange Fists go for really low, about a reclaimed, but a Strange Kritzkrieg (which can only be obtained by a very rare Mann co Crate 30) sells for 8-10 keys. newlinechar  newlinechar tl;dr: if you want your weapon to show kills it must be of the 'strange' quality, which are only obtained by unboxing crates or trading with other players. newlinechar  newlinechar If you want a strange I'd wait until you've got a decent amount of metal (maybe a ref or two) and hop onto a trade server and see if anyone is selling what you're looking for.

Now, it may not be as dramatic a picture as I paint, but I am sure it would be much worse. newlinechar  newlinechar I can't remember advocating abolition of the government.  In fact I am against libertarianism. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Most people want security. In order to have security, we inherently have to give up some of our freedoms. For example, in order for us to not be killed, we cannot kill. newlinechar  newlinechar I don't want to give up my Constitutional civil liberties though.  I don't want the president of the USA to have the power to disappear anyone he chooses by a mere accusation, without the due process of law.  And since Obama signed NDAA, that's exactly the kind of power he approved for himself. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;You want your 'freedom back'? What freedom. newlinechar  newlinechar Repeal the Patriot Act.  Repeal NDAA.  Re-affirm FISA.  End illegal wiretapping.  Abolish continuance of government planning, or at the very least, make it completely transparent.  Abolish Homeland Security department and TSA with it (we already have FBI and ATF to handle security, we don't need another department like 'Homeland Security'). newlinechar  newlinechar That would be a good start.  (There is more, like outlawing binding employer-employee arbitration agreements, etc.) newlinechar  newlinechar We should also enforce Net Neutrality, and permanently put an end to all internet legislation.  **No** ACTA, SOPA, PIPA, OPEN, PCIP and other crap.
&gt; Responsibility lies with the individual.. newlinechar  newlinechar Banks have to do due diligence when assessing a person's ability to pay, and they insure against it. If they took on thousands of people who can't pay then someone at the bank really stuffed up. The banks are to blame for that and I want them to stop before we have to bail them out. newlinechar  newlinechar Another way to think about it: were the U.S. banks responsible for all the sub-prime loans that lead to the GFC or was it the fault of the individual borrowers? Should those loans have ever been written? newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; no one forces them to take a loan they cant pay back newlinechar  newlinechar Correct, but why were they offering money to so many people who can't pay back the loans? newlinechar  newlinechar This is confusing individual loans with the banks' entire loan books.
&gt;Another pathetic attempt by the ruling elite to direct anger back towards easily controlled processes like elections. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Would you expect anything less from the Washington Post?
I'm not trying to challenge or insult your beliefs, I'm just curious to understand them better.

Well, apart from limiting the depth, I'm pretty sure that's the best way to do it. I would do it top-down, so you can put the div for the first comment level in first, and then add further levels as child divs. Otherwise, I don't think you can make it better. Would you like some more specific help? Can you post the code? newlinechar  newlinechar EDIT: Theory--maybe sort by the comment depth? That way you can add them in waves? You could even do it asynchronously if you wanted.

You can't assume formulas are as vague as acronyms.  I happen to be a good example of how wrong that is in that many years ago when I first saw the beginning of that specific formula I realized what it meant instantly, and all the implications.  I'd only read the series once, and I did not see the connections the first time through.  Sometimes it doesn't take much to convey spoiler information.  There are many other 'secret heritage' formulas, but that one specifically is what illustrated the need for the speculation tag in the first place. newlinechar  newlinechar Vagueness aside, the [spoiler policy](http://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/hvg3r/spoiler_policy_for_rgameofthrones/) newlinechar explicitly states that warning is required for *all* 'formula speculation.'

That's a problem, But honestly I don't like it because it's A: chance based, and B: completely removes your ability to retaliate. I much prefer Damps and Neuts as disabling concepts, ECM goes a little to far, even a random non bonused ship could theoretically jam a carrier packed with ECCM on the first try if it got lucky (admittedly an incredibly long shot, but still), and that carrier couldn't target for 20 seconds as a result. I feel like they could improve on the mechanic. I think it would possibly be better if for example, it removed a number of lockable targets for the ship. You could remove a frig from a fight by reducing its locked targets by 3 or 4 or something, and reduce the effectiveness of a Logistics by forcing him to choose 3 people to lock instead of 10, or even 0 if you apply enough jams, but not automatically shutting something down completely with, potentially, only one jam.

There were some relatively minor experiences which only seem mystical in hindsight, but what I'm really talking about is this: newlinechar  newlinechar I was travelling and came down with a bad fever.  As soon as the fever set in, I began hearing this voice in the back of my head saying 'submit' over and over.  The fever got worse, and I found a bed to try to sleep it off, but the voice just got louder and more insistent.  For whatever reason, in that way that you just 'know', I knew it was God, and specifically the Christian God. newlinechar  newlinechar The Voice wouldn't let me sleep.  I wrestled and fought with it for about 16 hours while the fever kept getting worse.  Finally when I was exhausted and crying and in pain, I gave up.  I just thought 'Ok, I submit, dammit!' And the fever broke immediately, and I fell asleep. When I woke up I found a Bible under my bed.  Over the next few weeks I read it cover-to-cover, and it had an extra layer of Meaning which had never been there before. Suddenly it wasn't just a book, it was The Book. newlinechar  newlinechar The other experiences over the next months came in the form of hallucinations (visual, auditory, and somatic) all of which had a deep spiritual meaning to me. newlinechar  newlinechar Having been an Atheist all my life I naturally thought I had gone completely insane and tracked down a psychiatrist as fast as I could.  It took a while, but I finally teased out the fact that I was not losing my mind, I was still perfectly rational, but for whatever reason I was now a Christian and those insane experiences were somehow a part of that. (It has been about 5 years and I haven't had any 'crazy' symptoms since then, just in case you were wondering) newlinechar  newlinechar I hope that gives you a bit more detail.  I could go on about this for a very long time, but I tried to keep it concise for now.

That's simply not true. A $10 order is probably going to be a pretty simple delivery.

By multiple trips I mean too and from your car, I can't imagine an order would be large enough that it'd require multiple trips too and from the store without an extra special situation.
Pretty much, I only have companions when I ABSOLUTELY need them or I have no choice. My sneak is 100 so I can easily go around and not be in danger... sometimes it back fires. Like when I shoot someone and it seems that 100 sneak doesn't actually matter and they detect me right off the bat... but then I can easily kill them with shouts or a bow. It sucks when I get over-encumbered though... then I have to drop something I may really like just so I can carry the new sh*t home...

Understood and a valid point. Again, I'm going to go back to my whole 'friends first' thing here. I am also cautious with my heart, if you will, and make sure I know what I'm getting into before I consider a relationship. I've only dated once, and it didn't work out, but we went back to being friends because that is where we were before. I would always take it super slow, especially as things progress and look more towards marriage. I understand completely where you are coming from though. Also, based on my family life (my mom married very young and got divorced after having my five brothers) I've learned better than to rush into marriage early. I totally understand your views though, and can relate

You see, losing fights is an art. Anyone can win one, it's just a matter of choosing a suitable opponent. Losing and most importantly, doing it with finese and style, on the other hand requires more ingenuity. First thing you need to do is pick a fight you couldn't possibly win, either because of the number or size of your adversaries, that way you can fight without having to worry about the outcome, since the glory is already yours. It's important not to go overboard and pick too skilled and agressive fighters and maintain necessary safety precautions to avoid permanent injuries. The second key to success is attitude. You need to be the guy who didn't start it, but didn't mind it starting either. Insults, taunts and mockery are crucial troughout the whole incident, especially if you're already bleeding. There are other important things to keep in mind like where and when to fight to avoid police intervention, crowd control, making sure your targets are not of the stabby/kicking unconscious people sort and takin punches, but I won't go into detail about them, unless someone's interested.

They were clearly stating they took issue w/the death penalty. Also, the note wasn't from 'a person' it was from 'the gun*men*' as in plural. Also 'suspected of' 'allegedly' and 'accused of' are news speak for 'not caught yet/not convicted yet.' newlinechar  newlinechar I originally read about this on the Wikipedia article about the MS-13 gang. Several members went to jail and the guy who orchestrated it was hung by fellow MS-13 inmates in there, but I felt like it would be awkward to link to the Wiki sub-section on 'notable incidence' when it's just one of many listed, and I was limited to one link so I couldn't link to the others that would fill in the rest of the details. Maybe I just which link to use poorly. newlinechar  newlinechar Wikipedia: newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;On December 23, 2004, one of the most widely publicized MS crimes in Central America occurred in Chamelecón, Honduras when an intercity bus was intercepted and sprayed with automatic gunfire, killing 28 civilian passengers, most of whom were women and children.[23] MS organized the massacre as a protest against the Honduran government for proposing a restoration of the death penalty in Honduras. Six gunmen raked the bus with gunfire. As passengers screamed and ducked, another gunman climbed aboard and methodically executed passengers.[24] In February 2007, Juan Carlos Miranda Bueso and Darwin Alexis Ramírez were found guilty of several crimes including murder and attempted murder. Ebert Anibal Rivera was held over the attack and was arrested after having fled to Texas.[25] Juan Bautista Jimenez, accused of masterminding the massacre, was killed in prison. According to the authorities, fellow MS-13 inmates hanged him.[26] There was insufficient evidence to convict Óscar Fernando Mendoza and Wilson Geovany Gómez.

I completely agree with you about blaming the victim being disgusting, but I would like to say that it's not because 'North America' is so backward and terrible. This happens the world over. Blaming victims is a common thing in rape cases.

In what way, may I ask? I missed that, and I've never heard Camus mention it in any of his essays on his work. Perhaps the closest thing he's said to that is his beliefs change between novels -- meaning we should take what he says with a grain of salt. That was a withstanding issue with both his fiction and nonfiction, however. newlinechar  newlinechar Edit: I see another way it could relate to your point in that the jury's decision is based on 'facts' with emotional interpretation. No where does it say that everything in fiction writing has a purely emotional base, however. You do have an interesting point on that, but I still don't agree that fiction writing is devoid of hard logic always.

Alaska was just kind've more commanding in my mind than Margo. There were parts of Alaska that I felt I already was like, but there were many many parts that I wished so much to be even more.

But there was just something about her that I understood, and felt like she understood and made sense of me that I never could myself. (wow. thought i was talking about a real person for a second there) And as far as Margo goes, I live in a somewhat small town in the middle of Georgia and have for the past 18 years.

If your ribcage is only 30' around, you should be in a 30' band (or a 32 perhaps if going to the 30 is a little too tight for you right away). You are wearing a band that is 8' too big for you.  newlinechar  newlinechar A few years ago, I thought I was a 34DD. A different calculator told me that that was my size, so I went out and bought some of bras. My breast tissue was covered, but I didn't feel supported well. The straps didn't always stay where they belonged and the back was always riding up. Then a nice woman clued me into a common deception that takes place all the time in our society. Bra manufacturers routinely use funny math to come up with bra sizes. For instance, the Playtex fit calculator on their website ~~says~~ said I should be a 34DD. (We recently spammed their facebook fan page and got them to remove it from their webpage because it was inaccurate.) My ribcage is 28.5” around, and I am 39” around my bust. They have added 5” to my ribcage measurement before giving me my bra size, telling me I need a 34” band. newlinechar  newlinechar If we were talking about pants (say Gap pants as an example) that is the difference between size 8 pants (28.5” at the waist) and size 16 pants (33.75” at the waist). Wouldn’t I look silly if I needed a size 8 but bought a size 16? (I know some women need size 16s and some need size 00s. But if you buy something five inches too big for you, it is still five inches too big for you!) newlinechar  newlinechar Currently, I wear a 30GG. (I know! GG! Gasp! It’s okay though, people do wear these sizes, and people do make these sizes. In the U.S. we don’t see it much because so many of our bra manufacturers encourage us to inflate our bra size) If I was wearing a 34 band I wouldn’t be nearly as supported as I am now. When I was wearing a 34DD, my breasts sat lower on my torso and covered up my waist (which happens to be below my breasts). I looked a LOT heavier than I really was. Now that my chest is supported properly, I look much thinner than I used to look.  newlinechar  newlinechar You have an 8 inch difference between your ribcage and your bra band! Because your ribcage isn't huge, moving to a D cup isn't going to instantly make your boobs look enormous. [A D isn't necessarily enormous.](http://fullerfigurefullerbust.wordpress.com/2011/09/03/the-alphabet-does-not-stop-at-ddd/) The 30D will lift your chest and support your boobs better than any other bra size. The 30 band is pretty hard to find in general, but it is possible.

I would recommend going to a store (32 is more common, and nearly ever store will carry a 32C or 32D) and you can try on the different sizes to see what fits you best.

There's a human in the middle doing the transcription, but you never speak/hear from them. They aren't perfect.

&gt; If not, can you explain what you meant by 'IT DOESN'T SOUND THE SAME'? IE. Whether you were referring to a technical similarity I'm unaware of, or your opinion, or if you were making a declarative statement on something that's entirely subjective, or if you were actually saying the waveforms aren't similar enough to make a comparison? newlinechar  newlinechar Well, you asked nicely.  Youtube is really shit for comparing audio but the jist of things is the same I think.  newlinechar  newlinechar [This](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;list=PLF80BC8A33E1C3EFE&amp;v=JAOe-WNiQLY#t=12s) is your section from earlier where you said it sounded like the first climax of the Skyrim theme.  [This](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=clcHxg9l5Bk#t=92s) is that skyrim theme.   newlinechar  newlinechar I'll (attempt) to put on ~~paper~~ text how I think they are distinctly different.  We'll start with skyrim.   newlinechar  newlinechar The skyrim theme uses a high-in-the-mix choir chant with some clashes from large cymbals and a 'beat' progression (no such thing as a beat in symphony, but I can't think of the technical word for it) that moves down in pitch.  The decline is steady and repeated for drama, where the cymbals increase in frequency.   newlinechar  newlinechar That's a somewhat simple description of the Skyrim theme, on to GW2's norn theme.   newlinechar  newlinechar The theme starts with up-front-and-center in your face brass horns.  The instruments naturally lack bass, and no timpanies/bass drums/etc were used to fill that side of the sonic spectrum, the sound is overall flat for the intro.  When you reach the 'break' at 16s, the sound changes alltogether.  You get a soothing coon from a female choir (vs chant from male choir skyrim) coupled with bounding cellos and violins with some timpany very low in the mix to make the bass more rich (this is all I can tell from youtube quality, have not heard this from a higher quality source).  The overall 'feel' of the GW2 track is one of merriment and winter festivities.   newlinechar  newlinechar Contrasting to the Skyrim theme, which uses peaking brass and a progression in sound to something *less merry sounding* that overall, sounds bombastic.   newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; or if you were actually saying the waveforms aren't similar enough to make a comparison? newlinechar  newlinechar That would be ridiculous, you'd have to start by lowering the volume by 6-10db in a sound editor just to get rid of the 'crushed' look that music tends to have.  To be clear, I'm not blaming it for having that look, it's a result of having instruments in the foreground of the soundstage while being mixed to peak at ~-0.5db; meaning things in general, are in the range of -12 to -4db, giving it that 'crushed' look.  A spectral frequency analysis would be a better choice, given the dramatic difference in how the two are measured (frequency vs volume). newlinechar

Well, not saying this is true for all Christians only some, but from previous experiences from: where I live(the deep south of the United States) protests, marches and mainly the internet and I've observed people make fun, scream, and even beat people just because they were a homosexual or an Atheist. This is ignorance because many Christians have not come to the conclusion that we have our own free will, which includes freedom of religion, and people, specifically homosexuals or Atheists,should not be prosecuted for observing their right to express themselves as they wish.

The point was that you have your set of beliefs or lack of and I have mine. I am just appalled by the venom I see in atheists as opposed to people of other faiths. I have Hindu/Christian/Sikh and Budhist friends. I respect all of them, I may not agree with their faith but I take extra care not to offend them or learn a little about them rather than just go all out Jihad on their set of beliefs. newlinechar  newlinechar That is the vibe I get from Atheists majority of the time. However I have met a few who can rationally express their beliefs without going on the offensive. newlinechar  newlinechar My experience would dictate that Atheists are the most xenophobic and hateful people on Earth but I am not narrowminded and see people as individuals.  newlinechar  newlinechar I, repeat, your opinion is no better than mine. I believe that there is a divine entity. You believe there isn't. I respect your opinion and am not shoving religion down your throat.

Because the composer's fingering might not be the best for you. Every person has different strong fingers and different hand sizes. Certain fingerings that are comfortable for one person might be a struggle for another. Fingering is just a means to an end. If you can produce the same sound with two different fingerings, then there's no reason to use the one that's less comfortable. Besides, most non-modern composers didn't put fingering in their works; those are later added by editors.

Things have changed hugely since our parents' day.  House prices are way higher compared to income, but on the other hand, mortgages are much more available (those two facts are of course completely linked). newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar In my parents' day, mortgages were restricted in number, so you had 'mortgage famines' where no-one was allowed to get a mortgage for a while.  Even then, interest rates shot up to crazy levels at times (18%) so that at the end of the day, the proportion of your salary that went to monthly mortgage payments hasn't changed as dramatically as you'd think, so in terms of getting approved for a mortgage, it was also difficult back then.  There's also the availability of lower LVR loans nowadays (although they'll cost ya). newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar What's completely different nowadays is the dizzying amounts of debt we have to take on if we want to own a house.  That's the real story here - we've changed into an economy where it's not the price that matters, but the cost of servicing the debt.  And you can't escape the game by renting, as rents follow house prices in the long run.   newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Low interest rates don't so much make mortgages cheaper, as ensure that house prices rise to the point that we can only just afford the mortgage payments each month.  Low interest rates have directly caused a transfer of wealth from non-owners to owners and will put our generation in bigger debt than previous generations.   newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar If we're buying a house now, then to expect similar gains as previous generations, we'd have to expect interest rates to get even lower and credit to get even easier to get hold of. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Renting always beats buying as a short-term strategy, but buying takes over at some point as a better way to build wealth.  This might have been about 5-7 years in the past, but this could be pushed out to 15-20 years if conditions are bad for new home-owners. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar I would argue that personal financial planning should be done considering your whole lifetime, so buying a house is still worth it, I just don't think it's going to be the road to unearned riches that it was for previous generations. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar So don't sweat if you feel like you're missing out on home ownership.  It's always good in the long long term, but it's probably not all that it's cracked up to be short term.  Spending another 5 years to build up a bigger deposit wouldn't be a bad idea so long as annual price rises remain below about 5%.

Recoil is random, but limited by the gun. When it says it goes .4 left, .4 right that doesn't mean it will always go .4 to the left and then .4 to the right and alternate back and forth. It just means that it will be somewhere randomly in-between. newlinechar  newlinechar I just did some testing myself and confirmed that both recoil and spread is random. The bigger thing I noticed is that spread is much more of a problem than recoil. If I just pull down slightly I can keep my crosshair in a fairly small circle, but the bullets will hit in a much larger circle, due to the spread. newlinechar  newlinechar After watching more videos of this shaking and testing things myself, I still believe my first post to be accurate.

Wages here are better than the states and the US.

Good guy Norwegian. 
as I said elsewhere I am no expert, but, that won't stop me from commenting.  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; it's clear that [people] overwhelmingly prefer to live in cities. newlinechar  newlinechar Economically speaking, your conclusion is not valid, or else is just empty. First, the cost of housing 'per square unit of floor space' is irrelevant.  Nobody buys a square foot. We buy or rent *apartments* or *houses*.  People ask of an apartment, not 'How much does it cost per square foot?'  They ask, 'how much is the rent?'   newlinechar  newlinechar Also, about rents and costs - the absolute number is meaningless.  newlinechar It's determined by supply and demand, you see. Cities, by definition, have a limited supply of space, which drives up the cost.  But if you look at the numbers, [the US Census shows that 51% of Americans live in the suburbs.](http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory?id=14173815&amp;singlePage=true#.TyiQHVwcouZ)   By that measure, people overwhelmingly prefer the suburbs.  And that preference is growing.  To say that 'people prefer to live in the cities', when speaking of the USA, is either a contrived (artificial) conclusion, or is just wrong.  newlinechar   newlinechar The converse is true: people in the USA perfer the burbs. The interesting question is why?  And an interesting side question is,  why are the typical European cities different?  newlinechar  newlinechar Seems to me that many American cities were industrial centers. They grew up during the industrial revolution. In the city centers, industrialists built factories, meat-packing plants, shipyards, train terminals - heavy commerce. These things are very inhospitable to polite human society. They were huge, dirty, loud, and dangerous, and they emitted so much pollution that they fouled a large surrounding area.  newlinechar  newlinechar People who needed jobs and had no transportation (no horse, no car) moved toward the factories and plants. People with money - the plant managers, the bankers, the city managers - moved several miles out, to get away from the dirt, noise, and pollution. Hence, Long Island. But this phenomenon was repeated in many cities,  like Chicago, Milwaukee, Buffalo, Pittsburgh, Cleveland.  newlinechar  newlinechar As the cities grew and democratized, and technology allowed - the advent of motorized cars - more rich people moved further out. People who aspired to be rich followed them. This process has never really stopped. (Only recently do we see some back-flow.)  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; **If cities in American were really built around the needs of city dwellers** (no cars, comprehensive public transportation, mixed-use zoning, green space) then they wouldn't be the alienating places that fall into blight and disrepair. Instead, they have to have highways and parking for the commuters. newlinechar  newlinechar And if a frog had wings, it wouldn't bump it's ass hopping. Major American cities were not designed primarily to support humans. Most were not even 'designed'. They organically emerged, as industrialists built factories and other commercial enterprises. After building the steel plant, then they built some housing for all the schleps that work at the plant.  Repeat enough times, and you get an American city. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; The real problem is that cities have been spoiled by *altering them*  newlinechar  newlinechar I agree with you that the typical American city is not set up to be friendly to pedestrians, walking traffic. But I disagree that they have been 'altered'.  Most American cities were  never 'designed' for humans in the first place, and to suggest otherwise is to romanticize the issue. The US city was about commerce, work, factories, output. The people were always merely resources to power those factories.  The housing was always *just barely good enough*.  The city was about production. newlinechar  newlinechar In contrast, most European cities are older. They grew up before the age of industrialization. The commerce that powered them was 'cottage industry'. Instead of a giant factory making shirts, there were 8 cottages with a few workers each, making shirts. They did not ship shirts to all corners of the globe, so they did not need trains. Everything was of a more human scale.  These places were mature and established by the time industrialization came, and when it came to Europe, even industrialization came in a smaller scale.  newlinechar  newlinechar The American city was never set up for humans. Humans adapted to the city, but it was never a human-centric thing. And the car-centric layouts of today only perpetuated what was already true.  newlinechar

Other than things like rape, which are not considered culturally acceptable, what do you mean? newlinechar  newlinechar Unpaid reproductive labor, less pay for equal work, systemic discrimination, etc. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; I agree this may exist to an extent, but that's not 'the privileging of the masculine over and against the feminine.' That's hurting both genders. newlinechar  newlinechar The enforcement mechanism of patriarchy may hurt men *in some ways*, but on the whole, it privileges the masculine. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; You're going to have to be a little more specific. This is practically a tautology. newlinechar  newlinechar Denigrating the feminine is one of the operations of patriarchy. For example, the feminine is linked to the weak, the irrational, the body, the private sphere, etc. all of which are themselves denigrated in our society in favor of the strong, the rational, the mind, the public sphere, etc.

First things first, assess your belly to see if it does change over time. Remember that on my end (staring at a computer screen) I can only go by your words. If the 'gain' you see *is* purely psychological, then there is no need for any changes. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; I'm also surprised you didn't immediately dismiss my thought that 3000 may be too much, as it seems to be right on the money for my BMI/surplus. Just a thought. newlinechar  newlinechar Everybody is individual, and although calculators are a good starting point sometimes things need to be calibrated a bit afterwards. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;  so I assume the other calories don't really matter much newlinechar  newlinechar For absolute weight loss, they don't really. However, your focusing on a few things at once (weight loss, strength gain, probably muscle gain as well) and thus manipulating the amount of carbs relative to fat could have differing effects. newlinechar  newlinechar Don't change them around now, since you mentioned it could be psychological, but just be aware that macronutrients could very well have differing effects on your person. Case in point, there are no high-level powerlifters on a keto diet because keto sucks balls for strength training beyond a beginner stage.

I literally can't help myself when I'm high it's a little like saturday night fever on turrets.

No one I know had matched me in terms of how much I do, my friends squirm when they see that jet black liquid cuz they always think I'm gonna OD.  I just say I like to be REALLY REALLY high, it sucks though because they always get higher off just a little bit.  It sucks when you have cartel connects because it's soooo cheap and sooo pure here on the border.  It's always brown powder.  It all took a toll on me tho I have a pic of how I looked bangin up two grams a day from jail and man oh man I looked so bad.  Face sunken in, 100lbs bruises from head to toe.  Kicking in jail sucked but it was good for me.  As soon as I got out my guy was waiting just down the road tho.  Suprisingly they gave me valium, immodium, and visceral in jail that helped alot.  So if you ever goto jail be straight with them they will help you, I even got an IM shot of valium while they were processing me.  Clean for two weeks and boy does it suck. newlinechar

I don't see that as evidence of slut shaming/victim blaming, but a consequence of the fact that it's aimed at an audience (some men), who think that facts such a woman being passed out drunk and wearing a short skirt, are tantamount to mitigating circumstances - that somehow make rape not rape.  newlinechar  newlinechar By defining rape as a sexual activity defined by the absence of active consent (yes) as opposed to the absence of passive consent (she didn't say no), I think the add is spot on.  newlinechar  newlinechar

Hmmm...  perhaps it could be argued that any anonymous person would be protected under the law, because they would count as citizens?

Well, all I can say is that Christians believe all good things can be attributed to God in some way.

&gt;there are a fair number of guys out there, including myself, who think you are sexy because of the respect we have for the hard work you've put in. newlinechar  newlinechar Certainly, and that's very attractive to a woman who has put in that work! However, the key here is to *express that attraction respectfully*. If you have respect for a lady's hard work and are attracted to that effort and you express your attraction by saying 'dat azz' the net result is still disrespect. A better approach would be something like, 'You've really put in an impressive amount of work.' or 'I can't believe you can lift that much!' or 'You've really been improving these last few weeks' or 'You've got good form in x/That's a great time for x distance' or whatever. Or (and tread a little carefully here) compliment her body in a non-sexual manner. 'Your arms are looking great! Your upper body exercises are really paying off.' 'You look really different from how you did last month.' Or whatever. If you're trying to approach a woman with a compliment, open this way - imagine your sister were embarked on a quest to get fit. What would you say to her to encourage her and tell her how proud you are of her work? Odds are anything you'd say to her would be very much appreciated by the lady in question.

First off, I might sound mean in this post, but it is not anything personal.

Or hell, as interesting as the taskbar in Windows 95?

What benefits does this product have over a separate phone and tablet? newlinechar  newlinechar Also, the benefit of being open is small at best. This special sale is the first time the ability to install apps without a central approval system really seems to be all that better. I have my problems with the app store (providing very little promotion for the cut they take, ratings system is a free for all, very bad about enforcing copyright), but it makes it impossible to make a bad decision while using the phone.  newlinechar  newlinechar I've also never heard of geekphone (though it seems they are still on 2.2, which is a bad sign) and I've been less than impressed with the Nexus phones. They are obsoleted far too quickly for a flagship device (the Nexus S still hasn't gotten an ICS update, and probably never will), and while the Galaxy Nexus is something of a fresh start for Android, it's brand new. It's may be that this phone will get updates on time, and apps designed for it will not suck, and the hardware won't break apart (although [it's already getting burn in from the software buttons](http://i.imgur.com/hbR6j.jpg), a problem inherent to the type of screen they are using. that they didn't put two and two together and figure out a way to stop that is a bad sign). But the iPhone has been doing that since the very start. Until google and samsung show the same kind of commitment, fuck android.

No, I wouldn't claim a faith. I have actually had a NDE, but it was a long time ago (before I admitted to myself that I'm an atheist). I didn't pray then, and it wasn't some divine power that saved me, it was modern medicine and a damned good doctor. The experience was part of what lead me to my realization that I didn't believe in any of that voodoo bullshit (though it was many more years until I could admit it to myself). I didn't see any lights, or have an out of body experience. I did however have the most complete and utter sense of peace, but I attribute that to the blood loss. I genuinely believe that people who have an NDE and see lights and have OBEs and see dead loved ones are just seeing what their subconcious wants them to see, kind of like a coping mechanism for impending death. 
I've heard that 'hands are deadly weapons' thing forever, but I'm not sure if it really holds legal ground.

Honestly, unless people see you doing a martial art, how would they know?

Actually, meth has been responsible for both of my divorces. I used and sold meth for about ten years and have been clean since 7/13/01. My first wife and I were together when I was using and then still together after I got clean, but the love had died on her part due to actions while I was still using. I was abusive (physically, mentally, and emotionally), paranoid, and having auditory and visual hallucinations the last year I was using. I also raped her once and on a separate occasion put a gun in her stomach in a shitty motel room after I lost our apartment by forgetting to pay the rent and ordering her to get in the car. I was not a good man. My second wife I got married to when we both had roughly three years clean. Six months after marrying she started using meth again. I did everything within my power to help her and secure her placement in rehab, but as we (should) all know, you can't help someone who won't help themselves. I haven't seen her in several years.

Let me strongly disagree about *Raiders*. The main problem of a *deus ex machina* is that it's a completely new, un-established plot element--that is, it doesn't flow from what came before. That's why it's cheapening--the plot is resolved by something completely external to the story. newlinechar  newlinechar This is completely different from what happens in *Raiders*. The ark is an element in the plot from the beginning, and it's well-known to have a mysterious power. It may not have been Indy who saved the day, but it's Belloq and the Nazis' hunger for power that lead to their deaths by leading them to meddle with forces beyond their comprehension. (To be clear, it's not divine intervention; the Ark would have killed Indy too, if he had been looking at it.) The ending of the movie flowed both from elements that had been well-established, and from character motivations, which a true *deus ex machina* lacks.

First, when I said 'everyone knows', I wasn't saying that everyone in /r/atheism is the same, you assumed that's what I meant.

It's mainly against Christians. newlinechar  newlinechar Finally, I didn't say that nothing good ever came out of /r/atheism, I'm just stating a fact: the majority of /r/atheism is bashing religion, mainly Christianity.

Whether the federal Affordable Care Act is based on the Massachusetts Health Reform Act isn't relevant to the point I tried to raise:  Since it was Romney who put the MA laws you're so upset about into place in the first place, I was just asking whether you were going to support Romney in the GOP Primary and possible General Election.  Obama is entirely irrelevant to the former; the latter was an afterthought.   newlinechar  newlinechar Romney, or anyone else, if elected to the office of President, is unequivocally unable to single-handedly repeal *anything*.

I just bought a nice gator strap for my Panerai from a strapmaker and it should be here in 3 days. newlinechar  newlinechar They mostly spend time on sites like Paneristi.com or other high end watch forums. I have the contacts of a couple and they usually take 1 week to make exactly what you want. The biggest problems with your strap would be the leather and stitching. You want a long strap and unfortunately it will raise the price a bit since it's more material and more stitching/labor. Also, the stitching on that thing is probably machine made. Handmade won't be as accurate and the thread will be a bit thicker. newlinechar  newlinechar You can do what I did last year when I wanted a nice tan strap. I bought an old used tan Coach briefcase for $45 with really nice patina and supple leather. Sent it to a strapmaker I knew and sent him the specs I wanted and my wrist size.

Caliber, oh man, people go round and round about that. Ha. It's true though, there are so many opinions. The basics are as I said above. You really have to just shot a bunch and see. I thought .45 was to big for me, but after a box of ammo, it didn't seem so bad. As I got used to the recoil I could put more rounds on a target faster.  newlinechar  newlinechar I don't know if you've shot a handgun, but it's not like on TV. You see people popping off rounds like crazy with no kickback on CSI. And you can do that too IRL, but there will be a ton of kickback even from a 9mm and you better be engaging at close range or have mad skills cause your accuracy is going downhill.  newlinechar  newlinechar The basics are they either go from being a heavy bullet that goes slow, like a .45 ACP, to a small bullet that goes fast like a .357. A .357 would have a flatter trajectory and loose it's energy more slowly, so better for longer range engagements. The .45 would have the opposite characteristics.  newlinechar  newlinechar Anyway, 9mm will kick the least. I've never shot a .357, but I understand it's very much like the 9mm. That's an option, but it limits the range of guns. Glock has some .357s. Might be a slim frame model you should try. It is a more expensive ammo than 9mm. newlinechar  newlinechar Now, if you mean will it really matter in putting down an attacker? I think there are plenty of myths about crack-heads that take 4 and 5 9mm rounds to stop them. 9mm is a proven personal defense round, you shouldn't have any reservations about it. My opinion is that accuracy counts.  newlinechar  newlinechar One thing to note about 9mm is the newer +P rounds. I don't think it will be an issue with any new gun from a major manufacturer, but make sure whatever gun you get is rated for it. I think everything I looked at buying was. newlinechar  newlinechar Guns are very personal, you're just going to like what you like. Don't get too wrapped up in opinions about caliber, it'll make you nuts. Think more about the situation you are using it for: if it's concealed carry you are not getting that gun out unless the shit hit the fan, you might be panicked, and you will want to pop of rounds as quick and accurate as possible. To me that says 9mm or 40 S&amp;W.  newlinechar  newlinechar I would go for the 9mm for it's size (the gun's ultimate thickness), low cost, easy availability, and track record. Probably look for the single stack, I would check out that Walther PPS for sure. I looked at that gun. It has a removable backstrap you can replace with a smaller one. It comes in 9mm and .40 S&amp;W.

Well, like in everything, context is important. If you have a bad teacher, or a bad subject, then their homework is going to be meaningless, big or small. But if you respect your teacher and want to do well in the subject you should engage with the attitude that even if you cannot see the relevance now, it may help you in the future. Remember, good teaching practice goes concrete first, abstract after. You give the kids a concrete, real-world example of what your talking about, then eventually (maybe not for a long time) you explain the theory behind it. This works, but it does mean that every so often you have to say the dreaded 'because I say so' (or some more polite variation).

I feel like this almost makes sense.  If we choose n as you do above, that implies that, regardless of the epsilon we choose, e &gt; 1/(2n+1).

But I could do something like n &gt; 1/e - 5 (which I think works).  Does this sound right?

This is all true, and might I add, plugging your headphones into your stereo receiver will most likely sound really bad, those things 99% of the time have horrible headphone outputs. This is because the receiver manufacturers have been cutting corners in the headphone output quality of their products, since there's no market demand for receivers that sound anything more than 'okay' with headphones. No profit to be made from putting separate headphone audio oriented circuits inside their receivers. This leads to receivers having crappy DACs for their headphone outs, probably with output impedances way off of what your headphones would like to be paired with too. newlinechar  newlinechar There are some cases though, that will drive headphones with nice quality sound, but those are usually older receivers, like tube amp stuff from the 70's or 80's, or perhaps some vintage Fisher receivers etc. newlinechar  newlinechar You can try it out though, see how your receiver sounds, but usually it is just a lifeless, really really metallic sound, with an awful high noise floor.

wait are you using esxi or hyper-v? the esxi version of veeam has its own vss writer (it can even truncate sql logs after a backup succeeds). version 5 of the esx version of veeam. i wonder if you are using a different version. are you doing veeam to vcenter? or veeam direct to host? newlinechar  newlinechar are you getting an eventvwr log error that shows vss access denied at backup time? how about dns/reverse dns? the timeout seems suspect since i backup tons of vm's from freebsd to linux to win2k3 to xp etc at all kinds of different loads - the main thing i find is that running the veeam server on the actual machine so it can do scsi -hot-add makes a huge difference in speed if you can spare 2-3gb of ram and 2vcpu for a few hours. newlinechar  newlinechar i haven't tried veeam 6 yet - still on version 5 which doesn't use proxy's. i found that running a copy of veeam on each vmhost results in far faster backups compared to any other method.  also what is your destination?  newlinechar  newlinechar esxi 4.0 is alot slower at replications than 4.1 due to the way it rolls them back up btw - if you are stuck on 4.0u4 i'd seriously update to esxi 4.1  newlinechar  newlinechar i've noticed out of the box win2k8R2 seems to throw vss access denied messages and i've had to do some registry changes to allow the vss writer to work proper but that might be because i'm still on 4.0u4. going to move to 4.1 but just haven't had the time to move production over.  newlinechar  newlinechar let me know what you see going on in eventvwr when the backups happen newlinechar  newlinechar

We have become a step behind the other top teams, I don't think that can be denied. We have good players - a top club doesn't just lose everything over the course of a few seasons - but we don't have the caliber of players anymore that can be considered among the best in the world. Many of the ones you mention are growing old, or are so young that it would be optimistic to call them world class. Comparing this United side to the one from 2008, or from any previous generation since the early 90s, I'd say it's a fair claim to call it the weakest one. Many of our core players have grown old, and they haven't been replaced by equal quality. This is all disregarding the injuries, which is the reason we've struggled so much in the past four or five months, but the squad is still a level below what it usually has been.

You don't sound like a loon at all!! Gluten is the worst. newlinechar  newlinechar I was gluten-free for over a year! And it felt great! But I still had pain, fatigue and other random issues. In December I went back on gluten--once I reach the 8 week mark I am going to be re-tested for Celiac. I was tested after I went on a gluten-free diet, and it came back negative, but one doctor said it could benefit me to be retested while actually eating wheat. Surprisingly, I haven't noticed a huge change in my symptoms since going back on gluten, but my health has been in the toilet since early November, so it's possible that I just didn't notice because EVERYTHING feels shitty. newlinechar  newlinechar I was gluten-free and ketogenic for several months leading up to my wedding. Still, I had numbness, fatigue, joint pain and GI symptoms. Twice on my honeymoon my left arm from the elbow down went totally numb. newlinechar  newlinechar I'm hoping to have some sense made of my symptoms. Then get tested for Celiac when I hit the 8-weeks-on-wheat clinical recommended amount of time. Then go gluten-free again. newlinechar  newlinechar If I have IC, I'm going to have to go on a pretty strict diet anyway, so incorporating gluten-free into that won't be a big deal. newlinechar  newlinechar Thank you for recommending this again.

&gt;there is 'looks good to some people, doesn't look good to other people' newlinechar  newlinechar This is not exactly correct. newlinechar  newlinechar The argument for and against the subjectivity of aesthetics is hardly novel, but when it comes to clothing, there is actually some very good reasons why an article might look 'good' or 'bad.' newlinechar  newlinechar Lets use your new hoodie as our example. The off-center zipper draws the eyes to your shoulder instead of up to your face, making your entire body look out of proportion. The large, shapeless collar makes your shoulders look smaller; combined with the amorphous chest -&gt; waist, it makes your torso look cylindrical. This makes it look like you're pretty chubby, but impossible to tell for sure exactly how trim/not trim you really are. The frumpy arms make you look even more doughy. Whatever shape you really are, the hoodie isn't making you look any more in-shape and doesn't emphasize any good things about the shape of your torso or shoulders. newlinechar  newlinechar There's nothing wrong with the style necessarily, which is probably what you like, and is something that is much more difficult to debate. Hell, look at veroz's asymmetrical outfits and you'll see it's possible to do. But fit is and always will be king, and the fit of this hoodie is not very good. Tricking the eyes into thinking something looks different than it actually is constitutes a large part of male fashion guidelines. There's some solid science to the way the fit of clothes is analyzed, so I advise you not jump so quickly onto the subjectivity bandwagon. newlinechar  newlinechar Whether or not you like Geaux's tone, he *is* spot on about this not being a very good-looking hoodie. Additionally, he has consistently displayed good taste in the past. If you're interested in browsing MFA to work on your style, then you'll probably want to try to not take offense to the comments your receive- it's not about justice, it's simply more economical to take the advice you get and ignore the tone whenever possible. Or, if you really don't care, just ignore me.

If it's 60 C, or the hottest day on record anywhere, ever, and you're having hot coffee, then i think the temperature at which it reaches your office is the least of your worries. newlinechar  newlinechar Edit:  For an interview, in all seriousness, I'd actually refrain from asking that question.  While it may technically be an important bit of information, an important skill for any engineer is being able to make valid engineering assumptions.  Asking what the ambient temperature in this problem shows a great ability to use equations, but little to no ability to compare the problem to the real world.  This can result in things that are mathematically correct, but are not practical, which is a huge issue in engineering.   newlinechar  newlinechar Additionally, i would say it's a bad plan to demand marginally necessary or completely irrelevant information.  One thing i've learned with my job is that the real world doesn't work with a set of problems where you are either given all the required information or you write 'Not enough info' and go on to the next.  You have to learn to extrapolate and draw parallels.  If someone asks you to solve an issue, asking for more information than is necessary makes you slow and inefficient.  If you have a bank of applicable knowledge or know where to turn to get it, then that will greatly improve your usefulness. Your accuracy may suffer a little, which is why you also must learn when it is important to be accurate, and when close is good enough.

Getting a lever pulled really isn't that hard. The mistake some people make is putting their levers in/by a heavily used main hall, assuming that if there are dwarves constantly nearby, one of them will stop and pull the lever. The problem is the dwarves in the hall are already doing something. The task is going to be assigned to some dwarf idling in the dining room or who just finished carrying a chair to the furniture stockpile. newlinechar  newlinechar Some people put all their levers in one room with a bit of food and booze (and [\[N\]otes](http://df.magmawiki.com/index.php/Note) of course). Then, during emergencies, they restrict a dwarf (or two, for redundancy) to that room with burrows, then either seal the room, or restrict the lever pulling with the [workshop Profile](http://df.magmawiki.com/index.php/DF2010:Manager#Setting_workshop_profiles) so only the dwarves in the room are eligible to be chosen for the pull lever job.
Stretching with silicone isn't the best idea. It's a very porous material, and as such harvests bacteria. Plus, because of the porousness, the skin of your lobe can fuse to the plug.

I know you don't like people who stop by just to say they hate it, but you have to at least acknowledge that in a real-world setting people will walk by your exhibitions and say 'the fuck is this, retard?' regardless of how well you do something.  newlinechar  newlinechar It's your responsibility to examine yourself and decide if it's an outlier opinion or if there's something wrong with *your* execution or presentation that is creating that reaction. The point is, it isn't the audiences fault for hating it (for whatever reason), it always the artist's responsibility for the reactions they produce, it's the freedom of the artist, however, to simply ignore this reaction, or examine it and change what caused it.  newlinechar  newlinechar By all means you can produce art the way you want, that's the big idea.

I don't know a quick way other than besieging a town or attacking a party that has a ridiculous amount of Swadian recruits as prisoners. newlinechar  newlinechar A slow but very rewarding method is to raise your relations with villages. It's a lot of work but it's damned worth it for multiple reasons. One reason is that higher relation villages will offer more recruits.  newlinechar  newlinechar Three other reasons are higher income (if you own it as a fief), the short term money payment from completing quests, and the opportunity for honor if you turn down payment for doing bandit extermination quests (if a village is overrun by bandits, a villager will show up in the taverns of local towns which I'm pretty sure is a reference to The Seven Samurai).  newlinechar  newlinechar Sometimes if the village has high enough relation with you (and prosperity maybe) they will even offer recruits that are 1 tier higher, such as militia or basic archers. newlinechar  newlinechar I'm not sure what the ratio of recruits to relation is, or even if it is a linear relationship, but I have few villages in Native with ~90 relation and they offer ~10-30 recruits/militia/basic archers every time recruits are available.

That's just stupid.  51-55 are HARD years for women, but early thirties are a woman's physical prime.  More to the point, what the hell kind of backward 17th century thinking has you so convinced that a woman's only value to a man is her physique?  And has the thought ever occurred to you that men get older too?  A 33 year old woman could be looking VERY young and nubile to a 44 year old man. newlinechar  newlinechar 'That 'nice guy' that was devoted to you but you wouldn't date? That's the quality of man you're capable of inspiring family level devotion from' ... Oh God that's such a disgusting statement.  Men learn to love women over time, and 'family level devotion' is something that grows over time, too.  It doesn't just happen overnight.  Sometimes a guy who is afraid of commitment is actually just afraid of having his heart broken.  Sometimes when you take the time to show that guy that his heart is safe in your hands, he'll give it to you.  It's not something you earn by having a great ass.

I agree. Weird that they're DLC, but at the same time not surprising in the least that there is DLC, that's unfortunately the state of the gaming industry today. newlinechar  newlinechar While a lot of people will complain about the specifics of the DLC or costs or whatever, I for one am happy with the approach they're taking here, compared to other games. DLC is an inevitability these days, so what am I happy about?  newlinechar  newlinechar For starters, that the characters are so cheap, as you said. Compare to $7-8 each iirc for Blazblue characters, $5 each for KOF13 characters, and $5 each for Marvel (I don't know how much MK9 characters were so I can't comment there).  newlinechar  newlinechar The fact that the characters are available day 1 is great. Again, day 1 DLC sucks, but it's not going away. For a game that's going to be played competitively, putting important aspects (characters) of the game out the first day is much better than holding them off for weeks or months when they're already done. newlinechar  newlinechar The majority of this DLC is not important. Costumes are obviously aesthetic only and don't impact gameplay. Gems more than likely won't be used for tournament play so they're there if people want to mess with them casually and nothing more. Boss character unlocks are an ease-of-use feature, and honestly something I like, *if* unlocks have to exist in the game at all. KOF13 recently had a color unlocker come out as DLC; pay $3 and you can use all the colors for every character, instead of having to unlock them by playing 40 games with each of them. The unlocker here is, in effect a bit different, since it's unlocking characters to play instead of an aesthetic item or bonus mode, but since they decided to have unlockable characters, the ability to get them quickly for a couple bucks is something that NEEDS to exist for tournament purposes at least, in my opinion. Obviously the preferred option would be to not have unlockable characters in fighting games, but this is still a step closer than having them be unlock only without the quick-unlock alternative. newlinechar  newlinechar Of course we'd all love to go back to a world where pre-made DLC doesn't exist and you get the 'full' game when you buy it, but since DLC is inevitable nowadays, at least they're making some better choices about how they do it.
&gt; What if we told all straight people they can't have straight sex anymore and they must fuck the same sex. newlinechar  newlinechar They have very strict rules about sex in general: you may only fuck the person you are married to.

Just looking at Oblivion side by side to Skyrim i'd have to agree that Oblivion had more color. BUT Skyrim looks as much like a province to the north as i could force myself to imagine.

No. Because the contradiction that is used to make the argument valid depends on establishing the consequent of the conditional, you need to assume or establish the antecedent of the conditional. In this new form 3 is not and does not imply the antecedant of 2. newlinechar  newlinechar It's a nice try though, but to maintain the illusion of soundness you must both hide the contradiction and then bring it out with a valid and well known rule, *modus popendo ponens* being the most common.

Not all music is produced by man. I think it meant the idea of being able to hear birds sing,or melody in the wind.

I know why partials exist, but what I'm asking is why there are two different kinds of template files: templates, and partials, with different naming conventions (controller/action.html.erb vs controller/_action.html.erb), two different calling conventions (render 'action' vs. render :partial =&gt; 'action') when (so far as I know), there isn't really much of a difference between them beyond the inconsistencies of features being developed for one and not the other. newlinechar  newlinechar So why not dry things up, and get rid of the distinction?

Nope..  the campaign is involved in the moneybombs now and they're making it clear that they want/need more frequent and smaller moneybombs so they've basically run the well dry.

Yeah I'm not personally sure on the coroplast. I know it's nice stuff, but it can be expensive as well as hard to find and transport. I just never liked fleece because of the smell, but a LOT of people use it. :) newlinechar  newlinechar That diet sounds fine. Widely used in a lab setting. Make sure that if you can't get a hold of it again that you give plenty of time to switch food rather than making a complete change at once. :)  newlinechar  newlinechar For a higher protein intake for babies... At 6-7 weeks rats are totally weaned and will do perfectly fine on a regular lab block diet. If you really want to, it's fine until they're about 10 weeks-- but after that they need to go on a regular diet anyway. I'm not even personally okay with dog kibble for dogs because of all the gross ingredients in it, and feed my dog the FreshPet roll food. The only kibble I'd suggest is California Naturals or Wellness blend. They're a little bit pricy and contain too much food for a couple of rats for a couple of weeks. I wouldn't really bother with a high-pro. Just make sure they have a good diet and get all the food they can eat so they grow up big and strong.  newlinechar  newlinechar When you say 6 weeks, are you sure the bars of your cage are narrow enough? They look like they're about 1/2'.. could be a full inch. I can't really tell from the picture. It's possible for a 6 week old rat to escape a cage with bar spacing more than 1/2'. If it's possible for you, it may be in your best interest to wrap the cage very tightly in some kind of chicken wire for the first few weeks, or even keep your rats in a small cage until they're just a bit bigger. Wrapping with wire is quick and easy, but has to be done tight.  newlinechar  newlinechar If you can get a hold of Back2Nature I'd definitely suggest it. The cage still has to be cleaned every 2 weeks in my case-- but from what I understand some people are going twice weekly on whatever bedding they use. So that's a big difference. If you use the fleece you'll have to wash probably twice a week, and it's better to do a load of only the rats fleece.  newlinechar  newlinechar I didn't recommend many chew toys. Sorry for that. I'll give my rats rawhide under supervision. Sometimes I'll put a small box in the cage that they can crawl in and chew up. A good size shipping box (like 10'x10'x5') can last me a pretty good while. The lab blocks also help due to the fact that they're really crunchy. If you want to 'waste money' you can get some chew sticks-- I wouldn't trust a stick picked up out of my yard, even if it were boiled and sanitized.

We may be straying rather far off-topic here, but whatever. newlinechar  newlinechar You can safely ignore most of those settings.  Until you're pretty confident in your skills, it's likely your camera will pick better settings than you will for most of its functions.  Even if you do nothing more than decide what to focus on and zoom properly to frame your shot, the camera will usually sort things out.  All those options are great for taking shots of fast motion or in the dark, although most cameras have pretty capable presets even then. newlinechar  newlinechar The white balance seems to be the setting cameras have the hardest time with.  Auto will work okay, but you almost always get better results from setting it yourself.  Usually, you just want to set the option corresponding to your light source.  Since it's a DSLR and most don't give a live display, you might have to snap a test shot to check your results when you first start shooting each day/event/whatever.  If there's something in your shot which really ought to be pure white, then you should learn how to use the manual white balance setting.  It'll make a huge difference.

Thanks for a thorough review and excellent compliment! Glad to see my worked is enjoyed =) newlinechar  newlinechar I did intentionally limit the solid blocks prior to the Keep area mainly to slow down a manual bridging attempt across the 22 block gap.

Right now they don't do shit, but I also don't expect this map to make it to any tournament anytime soon =P. That is the only instance of a 1.2 required mechanic. Vine climbing is not required as I have ladders where they are needed. newlinechar  newlinechar There are 12 enderman spawners in that adminium tower in the Pearl Jumps region as well as 40 pearls. **Come to think of it... my logic for the limit of pearls is pretty flawed** so I will have a chest at all 12 platforms or triple the amount in each platform. I do however, want to keep all of the ender pearls on the platforms to prevent players from obtaining a stockpile of pearls. High risk, high reward to take all of the pearls back with you =P newlinechar  newlinechar As for the redstone, thanks for the compliment. Literally half of my time was designing and testing the systems to ensure flawless functioning. The redstone systems are as follows: newlinechar  newlinechar * Starting team gates (medium complexity) newlinechar  newlinechar * Detonating ceiling (low complexity) newlinechar  newlinechar * 3 of the rail stations (low complexity) newlinechar  newlinechar * Pyramid zombie trap (low complexity) newlinechar  newlinechar * Auto completing wooden drawbridge (high complexity) newlinechar  newlinechar * The auto reloading 12 shot TNT bombing arrow controlled thing... (holy sweet baby jesus) newlinechar  newlinechar I also have a VERY compact (4x4x3) infinite use arrow controlled pulse trigger that can be used instead of those ugly ass redstone across the void in a lot of other maps. It requires a player to be in the chunk to be active, but it will save the stat until a player arrives, so it could make for a fun 'proximity mine' kind of deal. newlinechar  newlinechar It could be used to crush someone in a hallway or release lava for a set amount of time, but I stuck with the minecart trigger because I could only load 12 TNT into the trap anyway. A lack of carts means that TNT bomber is empty. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; **Thank-you for the feedback! I will be changing the amount of pearls**

LOL, 'for many reasons'?  You think women randomly experience immaculate conception several times in their lives?  Unless you are talking about rape, every single one of those reasons is controlled by the woman's choices and actions (or lack thereof). newlinechar  newlinechar Jeez, did you fail 9th grade science?  You obviously don't understand the difference between sperm cells, unfertilized eggs and a conceived human being (a.k.a. a fertilized egg).  Sperm can NOT become viable without an egg, nor can an egg become another human being without sperm.  What happens naturally that's out of the woman's control is one thing, but murdering human life because the woman can't/won't take responsibility for her choices is another.  And don't try to take this as absolving the man in the equation because that's not what I'm saying.  
These conversations just devolve into pointlessness. You need to defend being open to axioms with no fruit to bear so badly that you think the extent to which we've built off things just working to then explaining why then building off those reasons, only to show those new things 'just work' as well. You can open up the flood gates where all axioms are created equal. Enjoy. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Response to the comment before deletion: newlinechar  newlinechar I'm trying to say that we don't just get something that works then make up why and accept it. When things work, we try to explain with models, then take things consistent with the models, see if they work, then do this tens of thousands of times, then keep the model that works with all of these, then you try to paint this picture as axioms we just circularly accept? I think you're trivializing it. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar I think what's being established by that is that religion can have good effects and bad effects, depending on the contents of the religion. What axioms I was actually talking about is say taking it as an axiom that a god exists, then using that to build from. I don't think that provides any fruits.

But it's not insignificant either - and there's no way I'd sign up. On the other extreme, pay me $8k/mo, plus benefits, plus hazard pay, and increment my pay by $500/year - I would sign up in a heartbeat. newlinechar  newlinechar Well, probably under 8k/mo is enough. It would depend on what kind of professional army Singapore thinks it needs, which in turn depends on what threats exist not just now, but in 20 years' time. newlinechar  newlinechar I can kind of see the point that the country doesn't want a repeat of the Japanese occupation of WWII, and that something has to be done to mitigate its relative geographical vulnerability.

I have at times had resentment for my mom, but I don't blame her. We were very poor and my mom's family lived across the country.

My wife comes from a very loving, traditional family. Her parents are immigrants who have worked hard to pull themselves up, so she is very self-sufficient.

&gt;My point is it's zero sum.  newlinechar  newlinechar It's not zero sum.  It's not true that the income of those at the margin will fall to the extent that the wages of those who currently earn zero wages rise. newlinechar  newlinechar The overall demand for labor would almost certainly rise, especially in a  depression, as investments that were postponed, are finally made because they were awaiting a fall in costs. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;So you hire more people and their quality of life slightly improves but then suddenly a woman can't feed her children. newlinechar  newlinechar Slightly improved?  They go from zero wages to earning a living.  That's a HUGE jump. newlinechar  newlinechar You seem to be more concerned with those who are better off, than you are with those who are WORST off. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Remember the end goal is to make a livable wage, not create full employment.  newlinechar  newlinechar It's impossible to pay someone an unlivable wage. newlinechar  newlinechar And you're ignoring a crucial fact.  With lower wages comes lower business costs.  Lower business costs means lower prices of goods. newlinechar  newlinechar You're fallaciously holding prices equal when you contemplate a fall in wages, when you have to also take into account prices of goods and services. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Without the former the latter is just a superficial statistic. newlinechar  newlinechar Tell that to the millions of people currently earning zero wages.  Tell them that they are just 'a statistic.' newlinechar  newlinechar Sorry for saying this, but you sound like a major douchebag.

Nobody complains about fan-inspired content. There is SHITLOADS of it just waiting to be put in the game on this subreddit alone! Not to mention ideas on the forums!  newlinechar  newlinechar Tim Buckley is not just a simple, average fan. He is a representative of the gaming community, and unfortunately, he does not represent it well. I hate to put him in that job, but for some people, he was and is.  Just because you didn't know what he's done and how he acts towards people who would be his fans, doesn't give you the right to come in here and shit all over our opinions either. newlinechar  newlinechar I want someone who worked hard and talked to people and made some friends along the way to win this prize. Not some charity fraud unfunny asshole who just needs to put up his link and beg for a few new accounts to be made.  newlinechar  newlinechar I will bet you anything, if Penny Arcade did that, there would be a new milestone tomorrow.

In August 2006 Cosby made an undisclosed out of court settlement following a lawsuit against him by a Canadian woman who claimed he had attacked her in his Philadelphia home in 2004.[30][27][31] The woman claimed she had been sexually assaulted after being giving pills when she had complained of feeling stressed. The suit also alleged that at least 10 other women had been assaulted by Cosby in similar circumstances previously.[32]

Well, be smart about it, don't be a tool. But seriously, if you get that teen angst where you're like 'OH NO DID I JUST SAY THE WRONG THING AND RUIN EVERYTHING', do your best to just shrug it off and move on. She'll like the fact that you look like you're not trying to impress her. Girls on the whole find neediness and obsequiousness to be a big turn off.

That's what I got caught up with for a while, just continuously looking for something I find enjoyable. With just the unlimited amount of material on the internet (disregarding the countless number of hobbies you can pick up), it's an endless pursuit. I've found that I'm a lot happier in life in general when I just take the time to sit back and enjoy anything I'm doing to it's fullest extent. Even if it's just drinking a coffee. This especially helps with stress.

&gt; The more we understand, and the deeper it gets, the bigger God gets in my eyes. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; It means understanding that God created erosion, with the intent of creating patterns in the Earth like the Grand Canyon, and the gently rolling Appalachian Mountains. newlinechar  newlinechar I have heard this explanation before, but it still leaves my question unanswered for the most part. What purpose does positing God actually add to the natural processes that science has discovered the inner workings of? I suppose what I'm looking for more than anything is explanatory power, but it seems like presuming that your God is behind the inner workings of the universe doesn't really add any explanatory power. Even if we assume God is self evident, what do we now know about the universe that we don't know through empiricism? newlinechar  newlinechar More than anything, I'm not particularly against people believing in God as long as they don't ignore science as a result. Heh, I'm in the middle of the bible belt, so it's hard for me to get away from Christians outside of my atheist meetup group. ;) Non-fundamentalist religiosity has always kind of thrown me for a loop, especially when it comes to Christianity though (speaking as someone who's been atheist all his life) since I have no clue how one decides to pick and choose what parts of the bible to believe or not when I've heard most of my life that the bible is *supposed* to be the infallible word of God. newlinechar  newlinechar And as far as the video goes, it's a great talk. ;) Tyson gives a great presentation. I definitely agree with his conclusion on how a religious background can affect scientific minds, but I imagine especially in this subreddit most won't agree with it.

JefeRico has some good advice, but I would add to it.  After you submit her, walk away and ignore her for a bit.

The Mad Men poster thing is dumb. But you are clearly not an American or at least not a North-easterner. Where I'm from, everyone knows at least one person who died in the attacks. It had a very profound effect on a lot of people's lives. Not to belittle the terrorist attacks other countries have dealt with, but 9/11 happened on such a massive scale that its hard not to be reminded about it every day.

But recall she didn't want to return to Pentos and be a Beggar King like her brother.  She had no army, and no idea that Illyrio would be able to provide one (why didn't he give one to Viserys?).  She knew she needed an army before she went west, and she found one.  She just hasn't figured out how to get that army to Westeros. newlinechar  newlinechar I think she'll take her army of Unsullied and Dothraki, ally with Victarion, head east (to go west), make a stop in Asshai, and land along the entire west coast.  Victarion will head back to Pyke and overthrow Euron, and Dany will land at the wall with her dragons to meet up with Jon, who now commands wildlings and maybe even the remnants of Stannis' army.  They'll do whatever needs to be done with the Others (I still don't know if it will be a battle, or that the Others are 'evil'), and then everyone will head south, meet Howland Reed on the way, meet with Victarion and his army at the Twins to destroy the Freys, meet up with Sansa's army from the Vale, and Jaime's army...ok I don't know where I'm going with this!  Who would even be left to fight at that point?  Who knows, maybe the wall will just fall and the Others will sack King's Landing!
Okay, a decent balance between fighting and talking.
I would assume that that would be because with a larger trench the temp is lower, so fewer of the other cannabinoids get vaporized? Regardless, I thought one of the benefits of the MFLB was that with the 'micro-hitting' technique the temperature fluctuates in a way that provided THC/CBD ratio in the vapor closer to the amount found in the plant.

I'm not asking anyone to like it or believe it.  I'm just sharing a deeply personal experience I had.

Ok, so imagine a hypothetical species that you want to save from global extinction. Aside from taxpayer funds, which group has the greatest likelihood of saving the species from extinction? The scientists - some having devoted their entire professional life to understanding everything about the species, the best knowledge, the best resources and with no vested interest in monetizing, let alone killing the species you are trying to save, or the big game hunter? newlinechar  newlinechar I understand your point - a lot of conservation money is wasted, or put to uses that I do not agree with - but just no. Firstly, zoos often successfully release endangered species back to the wild habitats. Secondly, it's only self sustaining if the species is sustained. Perhaps instead of shooting the animals in a country that the animals are really just visitors, they could have a breeding programme in place with the goal of reintroducing them back to their native lands.  newlinechar  newlinechar As you may be able to tell, I am not a fan of introducing non-natives to a  region for reasons such as this.
Bonuses are taxed the same as any other taxable income, at the applicable marginal rate. newlinechar  newlinechar The only difference is that for payments which are applicable for an entire year (eg annual bonus), there is a pay period normalisation step to ensure that the ~~applicable tax~~ *bonus payment* doesn't cause 'bracket creep' which would then have to be refunded by the ATO. newlinechar  newlinechar You might be thinking of ETPs, which give concessional tax rates upon termination of employment. ETPs only apply to certain parts of the termination payment and the amount of concession is related to length of time spent with that employer.

So for this particular (fixed) example, I get that 1/(2n-1) &lt; e &lt;= 1/(2n - 1) which means 1/(2n-1) &lt; 1/(2n-1) (because of the strict less-than, correct?).  And that's false because 1/(2n-1) = 1/(2n-1), so we have a value of n which causes the inequality to be false.  So should I find some integer value for n? newlinechar  newlinechar Edit:  So if e = p/q where p &gt;= 0 and q &gt;=1 and they're both integers, then n &gt; q/2p + 1/2 = q/2p + p/2p = (q + p)/2p. newlinechar  newlinechar So I have n &gt; (q + p)/2p.  But q + p &gt;= (q + p)/2p. newlinechar  newlinechar So n &gt; q + p.  Thus let n = q + p + 1.  Is this correct? (or in my n &gt; 1/e + 5 case, n = q + 5p + 1, yes?) newlinechar  newlinechar Another edit:  So if you didn't give me this awesome n value, how could I find it myself?  I think this is what picado was trying to explain a bit.

Perhaps something like a proportional system. It seems silly to me that your party can get 49% of the vote and get 0% of the representation. I think a proportional system would also encourage third party membership and force our politicians to compromise more. Of course, there are MANY different voting systems besides our 'Winner Takes All' system and I haven't researched them all. But our current one is just REALLY bad. newlinechar  newlinechar I'm not sure about Ron Paul's stance on corporate rights really. I haven't really heard him address corporate welfare, though that would seem a logical platform for his ideology. To me though most right-libertarians are focused on taking the power away from government while leaving corporations mostly untouched.

Successful IP is typically sold off once the parent company starts circling the drain. Unfortunately, the buyers will probably be Activision and EA. And they won't be rescuing the studio. They'll just be buying the rights. newlinechar  newlinechar Relic and Volition will probably re-assemble under a new banner and get contracted to make other games, since they have proven talent. They'll make 'spiritual sequels' or some such, like Irrational did with Bioshock (spiritual sequel to System Shock). newlinechar  newlinechar Either way, I don't think the appeal of the Saints Row games has ever been the characters, setting or story, all of which was pretty cartoonish and disposable. It's been about the alchemy of pubescent goofiness, masculine posturing, graphic violence, and hip-hop thuggery as interpreted by adorably suburban white boys, combining to make something strangely more appealing than its individual components.

It's totally a red flag, and I doubt I'm alone here, but there are sometimes those nights when you just need a self esteem boost of having a guy chat you up. You go ahead and flirt, and if it goes so far as sex, well, that's that. I think it's a matter of personal growth for everyone. I'm 22, been dating for about 7-8 years and only just now I've begun to go for the guy who's confident in his work and humor etc instead of the dude who just wants to bed as many ladies as he can. Then again I had extremely low self esteem and only recently began respecting everything I had to offer.

To be honest, I do need to re-read the Manifesto. It's been a few years and a lot has happened to me in that time. Still, the cruelty of the Soviet union does not seem much related to the world Marx is talking about. newlinechar  newlinechar Don't get me wrong, I'm not a Marxist (and I'm not sure many people are hardcore believers in *exactly* what he lays out): I think he was a great and necessary critic of capitalism, but his solutions aren't very managable.  newlinechar  newlinechar Still, Marx never talked about goulags and the other soul-crushing things the Soviet Union did.

&gt;For the same reason you can blame Windows for the failure of the other platforms, and the near death of apple. Undercutting the price to that kind of degree tends to do that. I'm not saying they haven't made mistakes, but to deny that the Android strategy isn't anti-competitive is silly. newlinechar  newlinechar FOSS is anticompetitive because it's mean to give it away? Never heard that one before. Would you say the same about Linux? newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;That's the Asus Transfomer, which kind of strikes me as silly more than anything. newlinechar  newlinechar Nah, the Transformer is a tablet that plugs into a keyboard dock, and I dunno if it's fully open - at least they haven't marketed it as such. The one I'm thinking of is something different, like a tablet with most of its hardware in a smaller removable phone, but I can't for the life of me find it. Google's no help when I forgot the name of it... Anyway the important thing is there are a couple fully open devices out there. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;I've also never heard of geekphone (though it seems they are still on 2.2, which is a bad sign) and I've been less than impressed with the Nexus phones. They are obsoleted far too quickly for a flagship device (the Nexus S still hasn't gotten an ICS update, and probably never will), and while the Galaxy Nexus is something of a fresh start for Android, it's brand new. It's may be that this phone will get updates on time, and apps designed for it will not suck, and the hardware won't break apart (although it's already getting burn in from the software buttons , a problem inherent to the type of screen they are using. that they didn't put two and two together and figure out a way to stop that is a bad sign). But the iPhone has been doing that since the very start. Until google and samsung show the same kind of commitment, fuck android. newlinechar  newlinechar As long as the bootloader is open and the OS is open source, you don't need 'official' updates - the Android community builds new ROMs from AOSP and you can flash them on yourself. But once Apple stops providing their official updates, which they have done for the earlier generation ones, you have no recourse at all. Sure, they support them a little longer than other manufacturers do, but after that you're worse off.

I only used that as one example, but there is enough to say about it to devote college courses to. That you know so little about it demonstrates how inadequate the history education we receive in the US is. You can't marginalize a hugely racist, violent, and prejudiced piece of history, no matter how long ago it was and who it involved, just because you it might not directly apply to your immediate ethnic lineage. America also systematically enslaved Africans over 150 years ago. Should that be glossed over too? If you want a concrete reason why Asian exclusion is an important thing to learn about, it is profoundly relevant to how we're dealing with Latin American immigrants today. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; I think it's Eurocentric because that's where most Americans descended from. It also ties the most directly into US history. Chinese-US relations in the 1700's wasn't exactly as interesting as US British relations. How much effort do we have to put into including everyone?  newlinechar  newlinechar It's called 'world history' for a reason. There are benefits to learning about things which are outside of your own background. In a K-12 education it's impossible to hit on every piece of recorded history, but it should be much more balanced than it currently is. You're right in your reason for America being mostly Euro-centric, but it's a kind of arrogance to think that anything that doesn't directly apply to you is insignificant. History is constantly being written and sometimes rewritten. Countries change, leaders change, and global sentiment can change in a historical heartbeat. Do you honestly believe it's not a good idea to learn a little more about China at present?

I think CGI essentially runs a Python script when you go to a particular URL - so it has the overhead of setting up the Python interpreter and loading your code for each request. More modern approaches tie into the web server via WSGI or a similar mechanism, so the relevant code is kept loaded, and it just calls a function with the request parameters.

I see this response on reddit almost daily. Usually for petty bullshit with anecdotal evidence.
My wife is also a writer who is uploading a series to KDP at the moment. Her titles were more simple and catchy, as well as her work having a very specific theme that was conveyed with that title. My books were not selling, so I thought I should experiment and see if I could change that. newlinechar  newlinechar My thought process was trying to think of something that did the same as she is doing. The story is set in space, so it needs some sort of space or futuristic word on the cover. It's also about war and has a few battle scenes scattered around the story. I wrote down a list of words that apply to both of these ideas: space, star, sun, moon, planetary, dropship, starship, interstellar, spaceship, soldiers, troopers, warriors, army, marines, military, warfare, etc. Some of these, if you're familiar with the sci-fi setting, would be nearing copyright issues: space marine, starship troopers. I settled on Interstellar Soldiers as a middle ground and, to my surprise, it worked. newlinechar  newlinechar I didn't focus any keywords. I haven't looked into that and so far I've relied on guesswork. I am avoiding putting in any keywords that might also have those same copyright issues. I have no idea if it's allowed or not. 'Hey my book is sort of like The Hunger Games, so I'll put The Hunger Games as a keyword!' No idea if that thought process would get my book banned or not, so I've chosen not to risk it.
It's both. They're not mutually exclusive.

Yes, describing it as an alternative to Wolfram Alpha is somewhat misleading, as WA has a lot of pretty advanced mathematical functionality given its roots in Mathematica.  LastCalc doesn't aspire to replace WA. newlinechar  newlinechar The Google Calculator analogy is closer.  It is not intended to be a replacement for Mathematica, Sage, or other comparable software, mathematicians are not the target audience.  It is more intended to address people's casual calculation needs, similar to a spreadsheet.  IMHO the various Sage web interfaces are ill-suited to this type of user. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; this really doesn't seem to have any unique advantage or use case newlinechar  newlinechar I have to disagree.  Google Calculator is only really useful for one-time calculations, and spreadsheets are cumbersome and limited.  There is nothing out there right now that matches LastCalc's flexibility and ease of use. newlinechar  newlinechar More advanced functionality is on the way, indeed there is quite a bit there that isn't yet documented yet.  For example, soon it will be possible to retrieve information from webpages and manipulate that information using JQuery-like selectors.  So, for example, you could create a function that retrieves the current Bitcoin-USD exchange rate for use in calculations. newlinechar  newlinechar And of course people will be able to share the functions they've created with each-other, the best being integrated into the default functionality of the website.  My hope is that this will give rise to an ecosystem of creativity, much like Wikipedia or Reddit, but with code. newlinechar  newlinechar (In case you haven't guessed yet, I'm LastCalc's author) newlinechar

&gt;Are you sure? newlinechar &gt;I have a lot of people give me this exact line, but their post is blatantly breaking the community rules, and they've plainly not read them or simply ignored the part that applies to their post. newlinechar  newlinechar Yes, I'm positive. Like I said before, I have seen the same link posted to the same subreddit a few hours after my submission, and get voted on and gather comments and make it near the top of the subreddit. Yet my earlier submission never showed up even on the New Submissions page. newlinechar  newlinechar I don't know how their filters work, but if the filter rejects the same link from me but accepts it from someone else, it seems like it's filtering against submitter, not content. Now I've been on reddit for almost 3 years on this account and posted comments on many threads which are available to anyone by clicking on my name. I don't think I have any unusual or particularly scary posting history that would scare a mod or a filter. You are free to click and see for yourself. newlinechar  newlinechar So it seems more likely to me that it is not discrimination against me, but rather promotion of themselves or their friends which might be to blame. Or else the filter is totally broken.

I'm not sure I would.

I'd draw a distinction between clear emotional abuse and persuasion, though. newlinechar  newlinechar '*C'mon, please.  We haven't done it in weeks.  Why don't you ever want to be intimate with your partner, anymore?*' - This, I wouldn't call emotional abuse.  Not unless this person was very persistent with that line of questioning. newlinechar  newlinechar '*Why don't we ever sleep together anymore!  You obviously think I'm ugly.  If you wont sleep with me, then I'm going to kill myself*' - That, I would call emotional abuse. newlinechar

Is it not safe to say that *most* rapes are committed by men?

My first real disillusionment with Anarchism stemmed from the topic at hand. Anarchist practice in the US isn't very congenial to critiques of colonialism and patriarchy. Anarchist theory doesn't really make those critiques beyond what it borrows from others and a general anti-opression line. I was frustrated with the Anarchist movement's inclusion of people who I think are reactionaries. This led me to take another look at Marxism. I re-read Marx, and I understood it much better than when I was younger. I read Lenin and Mao. I talked with practicing Leninists. I realized that my beliefs about Marxism-Leninism were caricatures and had little to do with reality. I learned that I had totally misunderstood the categories of Leninist thought. I was convinced by what I read and by the people I spoke with. Then, since the site of so much contention between Marxism-Leninism and Anarchism is history, I investigated the revolutionary history of the USSR and China and the revolutions they inspired. I learned that much of what I had been taught was just false, or taken out of context, or based on liberal assumptions of my own. Once I understood that, Anarchism lost what little appeal remained for me. newlinechar  newlinechar Now, that doesn't mean I don't like Anarchists (ones I know personally, I mean) or organize with them or hope they fail in struggle. It just means that I identify with a different theoretical framework and try and organize accordingly. In the nitty gritty of local movements it's not like everybody from Democrats to Anarchists to practically apolitical issue-driven residents aren't involved. There is a contradiction between Anarchists and Leninists, but it shouldn't really exhibit itself until there is a material reason for it. Right now I think Anarchists can be extremely hard-shelled sectarians, especially on the internet. It's not amusing to tell an Anarchist that you are with a certain group and then have them yell at you about Spain or something.

That isn't what entrapment is at all. First of all, entrapment can only be done by law enforcement. Second, it only applies if the law enforcement official is encouraging someone to break a law in such a way that the crime is committed but was unlikely to have occurred without the intervention of the official. Entrapment can only occur before the crime is committed. To say that Santana entrapped Sebastian is to say that she is an undercover police officer and forced him to do it even though he didn't want to. Third, the only thing this is even close to being is illegal surveillance, which also is not the case because there was no reasonable expectation of privacy to that conversation since they were in public.

Gotcha.

&gt;Unpaid reproductive labor newlinechar  newlinechar I don't understand this - do you mean women should be paid for having children, or that raising children should be considered a career and paid as such?

Less pay, *on average* (though women make more than men below a certain age, I think it's 30 or 35), but that doesn't mean for 'equal work'. If a man brown-noses or works hard for pay rises and bonuses, or works more hours, it is not a matter of sexism (both of these things happen, by the way).

* The biggest factor was my initial association of circumcision with 'genital mutilation' about 10 years ago. Before that, I didn't think circumcision was that big of a deal. I did feel like I missing something, but accepted it. I realized that the right to bodily integrity is more important than your parents' religious traditions and bogus/rare health concerns. I also got very excited when I realized I had tools available to make a change. I actually tried it out about 8 years ago with the older product, TLC Tugger, but found it slightly inconvenient. The TLC-X addresses those concerns and allows for strapless tension. newlinechar  newlinechar * The health concerns associated with circumcision should be treated when they arise, or upon any strong warning signs, not preemptively by cutting all boys' foreskins off as a general rule. newlinechar  newlinechar * Another big reason is to eliminate unnatural dryness, and provide some natural lubrication for intercourse.

I think to a degree it depends on what you mean by 'math'. If you refer to what mathematicians do, then math is an incredibly creative process. But this isn't what most people think of when they think of 'math'. They think of what was taught in schools to them -- they think of formula and 'plugging and chugging'. Your friend, even while figuring out how to analyze the data, may not regard that as a creative process because you're not *creating* anything -- you're *analyzing*. That is, you're not coming up with new ideas, you're looking at what you already know in a more organized fashion to see what it is, exactly, that has been measured. newlinechar  newlinechar Math, in the sense of what mathematicians actually do, involves a whole lot more than figuring out what formula to use and at what time. dwchandler's point is very important here: newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;At its core it involves not just problem solving, but *exploration of the unknown* and *imagining what might be*. This is how unsolved problems are solved, how new areas of math come about, how new structures are found within existing areas, etc. newlinechar  newlinechar Beyond that, it's using that exploration to generate new questions. Mathematics is often about figuring out what the right questions are -- and that part is certainly creative.

I beg to differ, from at least what I'm seeing. I work out with several 'average' fit males who do everything from martial arts to iron mans. Most are not squatting over their body weight.  I don't have a fixation with definition - I simply have a love for the fact that I am 'leaning' out. I have no illusions of becoming 'super strong'. I simply want to improve my quality of life. I've read enough that I know even without weights of any kind people get amazingly fit (simplefit, convict conditioning, your body is a gym). Those are my long range goals. Honestly, my goal weight is 170 - but I will probably try to make it into the 160's. Given that 225-245 is very much above my body weight at that point, I will be happy. I am attempting to transform myself into a small very lean person, not a 'super strong man'. I see no need to tempt fate with my back.  I honestly can't see how one word about definition qualifies as a 'fixation' - it was simply an observation.
At least they're fixing it...
Actually, entrapment can be instituted in civil cases when a confession of a crime is coerced, as shown by the tape.

This isn't an example of entrapment because it's civilians. Aside from that point though, in a case like this where it was done in a public parking garage, out in the open, and so even if the defence accused it of being illegal surveillance, that'd be void because there were people there, there also could've been surveillance cameras, etc. 
I completely agree, and maybe there was or perhaps not. Hard to say with this article alone.
Agreed.  I remember the first game against the Panthers this season, Greer was playing man against Steve Smith.  Cammy Cam was being pressured and just threw up a ball towards Smith, who made a superhuman leap over Greer to not only catch it, but land on his feet and run into the endzone (where Roman Harper subsequently launched into Smith).  The friends I was watching the game with were putting Greer down for that play, but I was like, 'what the fuck?  did you see that catch?  he had no reason catching that in the first place.'  Greer was in the right position, but Steve Smith went, well, Steve Smith, and made a big play out of nothing (as did Cam Newton). newlinechar  newlinechar Edit:  I found a crappy video [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZk2RVhFrOw)

You could apply that same line of reasoning to support the theory that whites are smarter than other races because most of the 'great minds' in history were white; or even more tellingly, that rich people are smarter than poor people because the 'great minds' throughout history have almost universally come from the upper classes. History is inherently unreliable because it was primarily written by rich men, and in the west it was written primarily by rich white men.  newlinechar  newlinechar Modern science has found no conclusive evidence that men are in any way inherently smarter than women, or that there are more brilliant men than brilliant women.

I would have to disagree. The reason Reddit is so circlejerky is because everybody has their own identity and ego here, that and the fake currency Karma.

You are all the same person, sept for tripfags, part of a hive mind and no single power to direct all that energy. I've often equated 4chan to a hornets nest.

Well we started off with one vegetarian, she is vegetarian because her great grandfather hunted whales... or something. She wont eat any meat, meat by products or even jelly beans. Everything in the house that has touched meat, pans, pots, utensils, plates, even the kitchen scrubbing equipment, must either be completely sterilised, or just not used for meat at all. However she will happily comment about how good my food smells and has no qualms about using animals for clothing. newlinechar  newlinechar She started going out with my other house mate, slowly turned him vegetarian, he claims its 'to see if he could do it' and often extols the virtues of not eating meat when she is around and then tells me he wishes he could have some of what I'm eating. When the subject of him having a burger or something similar comes up in the future she pokes and prods him in a 'hey, you're a veggie now' kind of way... it's odd. newlinechar  newlinechar The third vegetarian is a lovely person, she has been a vegetarian since birth so I cant hold it against her and is honestly, very cool about the whole carnivore thing. newlinechar  newlinechar It started with the kitchen utensils. I was fine with it, certain knives are to be used for veggies only, that's cool, however when I get yelled at for using a scrubber to clean a pan or fork... that is going a bit over board.  newlinechar  newlinechar Then, the fridge happened. We have a moderately sized fridge for four people living in a house. At first it was all shared, vegetables (sealed and otherwise in the drawers at the bottom (where they are clearly marked to go... by the fridge manufacturer) and also some on the shelves above next to the packaged meat. I come home one day to find all the meat squeezed into one of the small drawers because there are so many vegetables its not fair. That was fine too.. I guess, made the amount of food I could store, limiting. Then when the fridge started to smell it was always my fault cos I obviously left meat to go bad or what not. So I got a small fridge, big enough to hold all my food and drinks and stopped using the fridge altogether. Now the fridge in the kitchen constantly smells AWFUL... like really really bad, when I ask what is up with it, I get told 'nothing, there is no smell'. After christmas I came back and the whole place smelled really bad, I asked them to clean the fridge because some veggies have obviously gone bad, but was told that was impossible. newlinechar  newlinechar Here, we have 3 bins, 1 for general waste, one for paper and metals and one for biological waste, like food. We got a small bin for the kitchen to store food waste in to be emptied every day. So they used that, neglected to empty it and it became infested, they threw it out. Then the next logical step was to leave a flat newpaper page out, stack your veggie waste there and wrap it up when it piled up enough. Needless to say having a pile of uncovered rotting vegetables out in the open is not a good idea, kitchen was swamped with fruit flies and other insects. But obviously it was the meat that caused it, despite my buying of purpose made biodegradable bags, which I used for the meat and disposed of after every meal and heavily encouraged the others to use. newlinechar  newlinechar Lastly for now... cos this has gone on quite enough, I have a problem eating vegetables, I have this weird issue where the texture of some and the noise made by others while eating them causes me to have a gag reflex response. It sounds like total bullshit but I've been trying to get over it since i was 15! (A decade later and I can eat peppers, onions and soft lettuce! Go me!) but I am constantly lambasted about how I should really try this and that and the other and have all this vegetarian 'propaganda' for lack of a better word shoved in my face when they have seen my reaction at its worst (vomiting everywhere!) newlinechar  newlinechar I guess it sounds like I probably shouldn't be living with these people, but they are my friends, have been for a long time before we lived together and I would like it to continue being that way. Plus the rent is cheap and the location is close to my SO. When I (hopefully) leave in August my new place will be Omnivores only! newlinechar  newlinechar Sorry for the huuuuuuuuge rant!

Kai Leng attempts to escape imprisonment with a Cerberus agent who is undercover within the Biotic Underground (and who is a former lover of his) and are recaptured.  Gillian is forced to execute Kai Leng's former lover in front of him, and he is put back into confinement.  The Biotic Underground works out a deal with The Illusive Man to trade Kai Leng for a massive amount of credits; unbeknownst to them, Gillian has been using their plan to get close to The Illusive Man so she can assassinate him and take her revenge.](/spoiler) newlinechar  newlinechar [Aria's people move in to destroy the Biotic Underground under the guise of retreiving Kai Leng for the trade; Cerberus is unaware that Aria knows that Kai Leng is responsible for her daughter's death.  Hendel is on the frontlines of the assault as he, Anderson, and Kahlee are only there to rescue Nick and Gillian and flee Omega.  Hendel unknowingly executes Nick's girlfriend in the fray and Nick shoots Hendel at point blank range, killing him in a rage.  Kahlee finds nick unconscious after he takes a biotic shockwave, and revives him just in time to hear of the Kai Leng/Cerberus trade (which only three Biotic Underground members, including Gillian, are to attend).  One of Aria's agents executes Nick where he sits right in front of Anderson and Kahlee.](/spoiler) newlinechar  newlinechar [Gillian arrives at the Omega crematorium, where the trade is to take place.  She sees The Illusive Man standing before the blindingly bright crematorium (which, fun fact, 'converts objects inside it to energy,' lol!) and boldly attacks him with her ridiculously powerful biotics.  Hilariously and predictably, the image is a hologram, and Kai Leng takes the opportunity to tackle Gillian.

OK, I would say the fact that you answered so many questions is kind of a strike against you.

Either he thinks that the match percentage is super important (it's not!) or he is totally compulsive.' newlinechar  newlinechar On the bright side, I rarely take note of how many questions someone answered. Maybe others don't either.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Generally, I feel you are approaching the whole thing like it is a computer science problem. It's not.

I mean, I do work full time and I do enjoy my job. It also doesn't look as though I'll be needing to find a new one for quite some time. newlinechar  newlinechar Too much. Get to the point. Something like: I work full time at a job I enjoy. When I'm not working I'm .... newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;I'm really good at my job and I'm pretty sure that most, if not all of my coworkers would agree. newlinechar  newlinechar If you want to keep this part I'd drop the whole thing about the coworkers agreeing. You aren't going to be challenged on it. But I think you can do better in this section or at least add something else to this. Especially since we don't know what your job is.

Given your hair I might just put 'take a wild guess' .  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Books: Growing up, I was never really all that into reading. I had read some books recreationally, but not a whole lot. From late grade school, I could probably name all of the books that I have read outside of school. Jurassic Park, The Lost World, Sphere, Eaters of the Dead, The Andromeda Strain, Congo, and Airframe. Notice the pattern? I didn't read all of his books, just those seven. After those, I read The War of the Worlds. That was back in my freshman year of high school. That was it. The last book I read recreationally, The Cuckoo's Egg, I read about a decade ago. That is, until now. So far, this year, I have read The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo, The Girl Who Played With Fire, and The Girl Who Kicked The Hornets Nest. I had intended to read a chapter a day, but that didn't quite work out. I just finished Brave New World and I think the movie may have been better. newlinechar  newlinechar TMI.

Right now I'm reading The Girl Who Played with fire.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Movies: I enjoy many different types of movies. I can try to list some of my favorites, but I'm not really certain how long the list would be. I can say that my DVD collection is not small and that the selections vary greatly. newlinechar  newlinechar You spend a lot of time and space NOT listing things here. Just list a handful of movies, or, if you really don't want to, say something like 'My DVD collection is pretty big, ask me if you want to know more' newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Getting tired  here... But some other points: newlinechar  newlinechar * Your food section is TMI newlinechar * Why bother going out of your way to mention Sports unless you feel really strongly about them newlinechar * Your You should message me if section is all negative.

Well I think that it being so easy to create one example of the principle being bad is a good reason to think the idea itself might be flawed. newlinechar  newlinechar Sure, there are lots of situations where leaving things up to a market is a good idea; there are just lots of situations (like this one) where it does not solve all the problems.  There are many classes of transactions that a market economy will not 'sort out'; [Externalities](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Externalities), [Tragedy of the Commons](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons), [Free Rider Problem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_rider_problem) (a subclass of externalities), lack of [Complete Information](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complete_information), and many others I can't think of off the top of my head.  The market failure in situation the OP experienced can partly be explained by the lack of Complete Information.  A free market will not prevent people from being scammed, since the point of a scam is to trick someone into participating in a transaction without complete information. newlinechar  newlinechar The real crux of the problem with the idea that we should 'let the market sort it out', in addition to the general flaws like externalities, is that a company going out of business because of a market 'taking action' will not solve all the problems that company may have caused before the market 'sorted it out'.  If the market punishes my company for polluting the groundwater with lead and I go out of business that is great; however, it the water is already undrinkable and my company going out of business will not fix that.  The market is a reactionary force.

Since it sounds like the math is not what's being emphasized and n=0.65 is given, I think you just need to solve it numerically.

Then you can numerically solve Tanh[Q]/Q == 0.65 with [Wolfram|Alpha](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=solve+tanh(Q\)%2FQ%3D%3D0.65+for+Q), your calculator, or some other program if you want. (You could also use the Taylor series for Tanh[Q] and Newton's method to do it by hand, but it's not the 1700s anymore.) newlinechar  newlinechar Do you see how to finish the problem now?

Yep, there was a country-wide outbreak (in pockets, of course) last year as well.

As the vaccine isn't terribly effective, freaks me out quite a bit. I've gotten my booster and all, but I had to get a puncture wound to get my insurance to cover it or my doctor to give it to me (since it's packaged with Tetanus and my insurance doesn't cover the vaccine unless you're at risk of tetanus - yay US health insurance!)

We all have our own views on different sexualities, but yours is kind of odd to me. Are there really just two sexualities and bisexuals are just a combination of both? I, and most people I've talked to, see sexuality as a very personal thing.  There isn't a set number of options, people just are who they naturally are. Some gay men are repulsed by the idea of heterosexual sex, some are just indifferent to it.  Everyone is a little different, so labels like 'lesbian' 'gay' and 'straight' don't hold much weight as far as how a person actually feels.

That's a Marxist myth. newlinechar  newlinechar That's hilarious. Here: www.lowpay.gov.uk/lowpay/research/pdf/NMW_profits_and_prices.pdf newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;We show that profitability was significantly reduced by the minimum wage. Importantly, we also show that low wage firms were not forced out of business by the higher wage costs resulting from the minimum wage. On possible explanation (that requires more research attention in future) is that firms were making profits from paying low wages prior to the minimum wage introduction and that one consequence of the introduction of the minimum wage to the UK labour market was to moderate these excess profits by channeling them back to the wages of low paid workers. newlinechar &gt;We are unable to detect significant price effects, by looking at a limited range of consumer prices and by studying links between changes in producer prices and wages. The evidence that higher wage costs can be passed on in terms of higher prices does not seem to be present for the UK national minimum wage. newlinechar  newlinechar I don't think they're marxists. They're economists. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;It has a very large thing to do with minimum wage. newlinechar  newlinechar Perhaps you can explain why every other country on the face of the planet with a minimum wage hasn't suffered the same fate then.

We are not denying that women in NS (as teachers, etc) are contributing to the economy as well. However, I believe the impacts to the society are grossly underestimated. newlinechar  newlinechar It's not just a matter of 'starting college late'. The REAL opportunity cost to the society is the last few years before retirement of our citizens. Instead of working as their maximum potential, women would be 'forced' to be teachers or nurses. While I'm not saying that these are not noble professions, I believe that women would be able to serve better on a career that they are passionate about. newlinechar  newlinechar Secondly, not the whole women population are suited to these professions as well. Let's just take Nursing as example. Polytechnic students take a 3 year course in Nursing, what makes you think that a few months of training would be sufficient to train newly 'enlisted' women? Forcing these women to serve these industries would simply degrade the sectors they are serving in, bringing a lower quality of service towards Singapore Citizens. newlinechar  newlinechar Lastly, to fix the problem of shortages in certain industries, there can be other solutions instead of the drastic one to have 'National Service'. One such solution is to open more slots in tertiary institutions for the professions that require manpower. One such example of this being utilised is Nanyang Polytechnic's allied health courses, which are opening up to more and more students every year.

Even though Google continues to fund Firefox, Chrome has recently surpassed it in the desktop browser share, despite FF having a four year head start. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; there have been tons of great add-ons in the Firefox community that wouldn't be possible on Chrome. newlinechar  newlinechar Which addons are those? newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Whoa, what's with the hate? newlinechar  newlinechar I don't hate Firefox, I was just stating a fact. Firefox wouldn't be as healthy as it is now without the cash from Google.  newlinechar  newlinechar The main issues I have with FF are the fact that it looks outdated. It looks like XP-era software. Yeah you can theme it, tweak the UI etc but in its base form it looks very ordinary. newlinechar  newlinechar Mostly my dislike was down to the way it handled addon incompatibility. Upgrade FF and a beloved addon is disabled because the author hasn't kept it perfectly up to date. Yeah you can use the Nightly tools, about:config etc but that didn't always work. I'm sure that most FF users have at one time had to choose between an upgrade and an outdated addon. It's only today, with the release of 10, that this has been resolved. With Chrome it doesn't matter if you used a build that was 10 minutes old, everything still worked. newlinechar  newlinechar There are too many advantages (for me) to using Chrome that I would even consider going back to FF. The separate processes, snappier performance, integration with Google services, better sync etc. A good proportion of people who have stuck with FF maintain that they only do so due to specific addons that can't be/aren't available in Chrome, eg. Firebug, or more usually, the Awesome bar.
Wow really? I bought 3 leather pairs and no issues so far. And I have a canvas pair from about 6 months ago that are still going strong. Maybe you got a bad batch?
Well, yes, I could work at Ihop as a frycook, but that is not what I went to school for. There are tons of restaurants out there, that doesn't mean that they are hiring, and even if they are, it doesn't mean they are quality restaurants. I love my job, and I can cook awesome food for myself, so I'm not upset I didn't get a cooking job.

I think, for my husband and I at least, it's the collector and Lego lover in us. The minifig series, especially, each one is unique in so many ways. The boxer has a black eye. This guy pictured here has mutton chops. newlinechar  newlinechar I can't wait to get series 6 because there's a lot of unique colors and molds. Lego is one of those toys that even out of package and played with, is still worth a lot. So even beyond just as a collector, I can know that when I have kids, I can easily pass this down to them. newlinechar  newlinechar *shrug* Really tho, if you don't already tend towards collecting things (I collect decks of cards, I had to stop playing Magic: the Gathering because I was spending hundreds of dollars every month...), you might not get the appeal. newlinechar  newlinechar Oh, and minifigs are easy to display without taking up as much space as a whole set, so that might be another reason.

Oh, that's an excellent point.  Patchworks of narrow streets mean really nasty fires.  Historically (for more reasons than just the streets, mind you) cities burned down fairly regularly.

Here's where it gets hard for me to explain, but I'll give it my best. newlinechar  newlinechar I'm not saying that there isn't a natural explanation for my experiences.  But the wall that I kept running into was that if I assumed the most reasonable explanation (meaningless hallucination), it failed to account for all the 'facts' of the situation.  One of those 'facts' was that I suddenly found previously unimaginable amounts of meaning in things which I had spent my whole life thinking were only for idiots.   Occam's razor only works if the hypothesis in question accounts for all the facts, and 'meaningless hallucination' just didn't do that for me. newlinechar  newlinechar I hope you don't write this off as the ramblings of a mad man. ;)
