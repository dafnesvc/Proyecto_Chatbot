Faith does have it's positive advantages for a lot of people and societies - as it applies to religions/gods/ultimate rule maker-appraiser.  In my experience processed faith in a deity(ies) is usually expressed in two parts - the religious dogma and the resultant moral and ethical code attached to that dogma.  Most of the religions that I have some knowledge of profess similar morals of the 'be good to each other' kind (though often these morals are only applied to a limited sub-set of humanity).  This moral code uses a carrot and stick approach for enforcement - the 'holy' ultimate rule maker-appraiser will reward/punish you for your acts in life and beyond.  The promise/threat approach to the work involved in being moral invokes a chemical response in the brain (dopamine release) which helps sustain the work/effort for a future payoff (or avoid a punishment).  Faith, then, can be seen as a motivator for moral and ethical behavior - similar to a personal trainer for physical training; you could do it yourself on your own, but a physical trainer (with a paycheck that depends on a schedule and discipline) is likely to be more effective.  You can be a moral and ethical person without Faith (or religious dogma), but the 'learning' of Faith/dogma forced upon most at an early age requires more work to evaluate and, where applicable, overcome.   newlinechar  newlinechar 'Faith' then can have a positive effect on the person, their family, friends and society - an effect that is worthy of respect.  Unfortunately, since most religions are designed to be self-propagating and strive to grow (e.g., gain more power, wealth, numbers - whatever counts as their 'currency'), the need to subvert others to their 'Faith' is a prime theme of religion.  It is the strife for the accomplishment of this need to maintain/grow that turns so very many religions into large stinking piles of hypocritical bovine feces and negates the many of the gains which could be realized by it's basic non-expansion-driven moral code. newlinechar  newlinechar If a person/group has 'Faith' without evidence and with the absence of reasonable logical thought, they are not necessarily idiots, just unlearned.  Think of 'Faith' as cliff notes for life to get around working towards real knowledge. newlinechar  newlinechar Where I have issues with people of 'Faith' is when they attempt to profess their Faith is the only true Faith and use the corruption of the basic moral tenants of their dogma as a self-serving means to propagate their Faith.  Every time I hear a self-serving Faith-jockey, I feel like an attempt at rape (mental) is being made. newlinechar  newlinechar I do, and will continue to, respect those that have Faith, that believe and practice a good, consistent and logical moral code applied to all equally with the following caveats:   newlinechar  newlinechar 1.  Do not shrill nor attempt to convert me to your dogma.  Let it stand to be accepted or wither on it's own merits. newlinechar 2.  Continue seeking education about, well, everything.  Continue to evolve as a person, with family and with local and global society. newlinechar 3.  Consider that practicing moral and ethical behavior for it's own sake is worthwhile and view any benefit you believe that you will gain from your 'Faith' as a bonus that you modestly keep to yourself. newlinechar  newlinechar I am not very good at articulating the thoughts I have pounded for many years - so work the body instead of the groin or face.

Ok. This is going to have change how we talk about the NDAA. We need to make a press statement about how we feel about the signing statement. Its important to realize that the signing statement from what I read does give us something. Theres a dumb legal thing in American politics that means that signing statements do carry some legal weight and will allow interpretation by courts be very skeptical about indefinite detention, so its not a total loss.  newlinechar  newlinechar Its disappointing, but short of asking Paul Ryan to say something against the detention provisions in the bill theres nothing we can do. newlinechar  newlinechar This should only intensify our fight against SOPA.

I went from the i5-2500K to the FX-8150 to the i7-2600K.  Started with the i5, but the stock fan on it is terrible (reportedly) and so I need to buy a good heatsink with that one.  After the price of i5 plus heatsink, my boss tried to convince me on the FX-8150, which was like a $10 increment.  Then I was like, nah, want an Intel.  At that point, I was like screw it, might as well make the jump and have a solid stock fan.  I'm told the stock fan allows for OC up to 4.3 GHz. newlinechar  newlinechar I've never personally ran either, so I can't speak from experience, but the majority of people I talk to favor the i7 for fan and performance jump reasons.

Ok, I actually read the bill and I don't see ANYthing wrong with it. Here is the main portion of the bill: newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; (a) IN GENERAL- That the President is authorized to use all necessary and appropriate force against those nations, organizations, or persons he determines planned, authorized, committed, or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11, 2001, or harbored such organizations or persons, in order to prevent any future acts of international terrorism against the United States by such nations, organizations or persons. newlinechar  newlinechar So the bill authorizes self defense against people who planned, authorized, committed, or aided the 9/11 attack, in order to prevent more in the future. newlinechar  newlinechar Sounds like a good bill to me. No 'sweeping' powers here.

The leveling is persistent, but the funds you earn in-game aren't. Most gameplay is done through multiplayer. You *can* play single player, but you'd be missing much of the experience if you did. And so far, I can't think of any gripes about the game. It's brilliantly well-done for an indie multiplayer game. I also forgot to mention that there is a sort of rock-paper-scissors mechanic when it comes to classes and the special types of zombies. For example, Berserker classes (specialty is melee) don't want to get too close to a Scrake or Flesh Pound (both have high health and attack power), these enemies would probably be best dealt with by a Support Specialist (shotguns) or Commando (automatic weapons), so you can strategize your team's class setup.

You try as hard to defend the OT if not herder because I dont give a shit what some dumbass on the internet thinks. I was just trying to anger the OT only lovers by saying the prequels better (trolling) because they get so mad even if you say they are equal. And second who the FUCK are you to say I over stayed my welcome, well you know what you over stayed your welcome. And I'm not saying the prequel is flawless no movie is...I was just trying to defend that it is not so bad like you OT only fans say.

ALOT of it comes from the people you play with. Finding out your mistakes and fixing them. Finding why you lost that last game, what went wrong and how can you fix it. All the little things help. Also having a general strategy for most comps and waiting for the right moment to setup for kills/cc chains.

Bi in particular is an unbelievably broad term.

Try with a smaller belt. As is it's not really defining your waist at all.

You're citing from that idiot that wrote the editorial on it aren't you? (from snopes I think) Reason I ask is it's not section 1021 like he tried to say (which covers shipyards and naval operations or something like that). Even in the correct subsection it's 1032(b) that was in the final bill that excludes US citizens and resident aliens. 1031 doesn't mention US citizens at all. The bill was also written in a manner where even the waiver can't apply since it only applies to 1032(a) paragraph 1 (which governs the criteria in paragraph 2).  newlinechar  newlinechar I analyzed the shit out of this bill. newlinechar  newlinechar EDIT: nvm, I believe you're talking about the signing statement. There was an editorialist that screwed up the sections and tried to destroy the syntax of the bill making it fit his belief. So anytime anyone says '1021' or '1022' I assume they're referencing that guy.

Well the obvious answer is something with a striking falcon device.  Ideally a dagger with a falcon engraved on the blade (In the main timeline, Cullyn is a silver dagger (a type of mercenary) and has this engraved on his). The dagger is the most significant item to Cullyn, but it's mentioned that he uses this design in his clothes and other personal posessions, and it's a recurring motif for the character in other lives (reincarnation plays a big role in this series), so something else with this design may work too.

Ah!

I wonder if you're right. The North Korean artillery in that area is set on rail tracks that rolls into fortified mountain caves, and the doctrine is to only have the bunker doors open long enough to drag the gun out, fire it once, and pull it back in to reload and repeat. In WW2 the Japanese had stationary guns on Iwo Jima and Okinawa in heavy mountain and earthen bunkers, and *the heaviest aerial and naval bombardment in all of military history* left them completely untouched in their bunkers, where they were then used against landing Allied forces. newlinechar  newlinechar If we have the North Korean artillery sites mostly mapped out, we can presumably use precision bunker busters or other appropriate weaponry on these locations. If not, well then... I wonder if there will be low-yield bunker buster nukes utilized.

An important fact that I try to bring up whenever this topic is mentioned is the fact that the frontal lobe does not finish developing until your mid-20s. The frontal lobe is the part of the brain tasked with risk assessment. newlinechar  newlinechar The same principle is at play in regards to people with severe mental deficiencies from something like down syndrome. They do not have the faculties to properly consent, so we do not allow people without mental deficiencies to have sex with them. newlinechar  newlinechar Now, when I bring this up, the response I get most often is, 'Oh, well I guess we should ban people from having sex until they are 25!' Forgetting the fact that this response doesn't even address the science, should we? I don't think we should since the brain is far enough along at 18.  newlinechar  newlinechar Another response is, 'Well, then I guess I was a rapist at 16 when I had sex with my 16 year old girlfriend.' Though, again, the science is not being addressed, and this is a sarcastic response, I think it is acceptable for two teenagers to have sex with each other. While a person with normal cognitive abilities is prohibited from having sex with a person with down syndrome, it is not illegal for two people with down syndrome to have a sexual relationship. Hell, there are videos and training materials to help them to have safe and enjoyable sex. newlinechar  newlinechar I'm not sure what the ethical explanation is for that exactly, but there is something that just doesn't feel immoral about two people with similar cognitive impairments having sex with each other. Perhaps because the down syndrome couple, and the teenage couple are on an even playing field. Neither of them has an incredible advantage that they could use to exploit the other with.

The best thing about reddit is how it is organized, so you can find all sorts of interesting little niche subreddits, or even start your own, and be the mod.

I would argue that they are in fact doing it 'right'. newlinechar  newlinechar Perhaps you are correct in saying that there is little one can do to control the behavior of their 1-year-old.  Parenting babies is not so much about controlling your child as it is learning your child's abilities and needs.  These parents know that their 1-year-old is well enough behaved that they can take her out in public without being disruptive to others.  If their daughter was fussy, poorly behaved, or cried a lot, being a good parent would mean either picking somewhere more baby-appropriate or leaving the kid with someone else for the evening.

it would be an 'intelligent designer.' but it would not be a supernatural being. so if a god *must* be supernatural then not it wouldn't be a 'god.' however, the laws of this universe are not necessarily the same as laws in other universes so in that scenario complex life in other universes may have abilities that would have to be 'supernatural' by our scientific standards. i guess it's a blurry area.

Why are we having a straw man argument. Feminism didn't teach that men have unbridled and unrestricted privilege, and modern trans feminism addresses this. However the areas where men don't have privilege are directly relatedand as a result of the patriarchal system. Feminism recognizes that it's oppressive to *everyone.* I'm sure you've read *whipping girl* in which Serano reconciles a lot of this, including that a modern goal for feminism should be liberating *femininity* as it has a direct relationship to many of the problems we experience including homophobia transphobia, femmephobia, queer invisibility, and even dumb shit like masculine = strong and feminine = weak. newlinechar  newlinechar Sooooo, yeah. I'm not going to argue a straw man. And I'll agree that for a young trans woman the make restrictions of femininity can feel like oppression. Because it is.

Throwaway account because I don't want anyone to figure out who I am, because I know I will get fired. I work at a very well known hotel and we get a lot of celebrities. When I first started working there is was pretty amazing, then you get to see that most of these people are total a-holes. They always get their way, so you can never say 'no' in fact it's a rule that we never say the 'n' word, we apologize and say something else. Anyways, Keanu has been to our hotel several times, and he is the only guy that actually remembered my name, after about the 4th time checking him in! 'Wait, don't tell me....Ashley right?' (not my real name :p), it was so cool, he has a great smile :) And a great sense of humor, he's also the most down to earth person, doesn't have a chip on his shoulder. Anyways he came in really early one time and his room wasn't ready, I told him we could switch it, but he said he would wait the 10 min or so until it was ready (no one ever waits and it was just bad timing). Anyways, this VP from a very well known corporation comes down with his daughter, basicly dragging her behind him, she's crying and holding her doll, he tells her to 'shut up and go wait for your mom over there', he tells us he was late for a meeting and his wife would be back from shopping to get her soon so he wanted us to watch her. I called security over and a couple of guys kept a close eye on her (this happens alot). Anyways, Keanu saw the whole thing and started making funny faces at her, she started smiling and then after a few minutes he was playing peek-a-boo with the little girl for like 5 min. Then I kid you not, for the next 45min until the mom showed up he was listening to this little girl talk about her doll and describe all the things they do together. She had no clue who he was, it was so funny. The mom showed up and she ran over because they had to leave, but she whispered something into her moms ear then ran back and gave him a big hug and left. Then he finally checked in when she left. I've told the story so many times, he's treated as royalty here now.

With good reason! (As I know it,) the medical field is an especially difficult one to work in nowadays; insurance companies don't want to pay you for the work you do, patients get angry at you for having to pay a $25 copay for you to examine them using VERY expensive equipment...

Hooping is SO easy. Seriously. I never thought I could even make the hoop go around more than once, but it was explained to me like this and it clicked instantly: (I have since taught other people this way and they also get it instantly.) newlinechar  newlinechar First you need a relatively heavy, large hoop. A heavy hoop will be about two pounds--I make starter hoops out of 1'', 100psi PVC piping. You can get it at the hardware store but they only sell it in amounts that will make 7-10 hoops. There's tons of stuff on Instructables for making hoops. I digress. But a light, small hoop will not be good for your first time. newlinechar  newlinechar Get your hoop. newlinechar  newlinechar Stand with your feet hip-width apart, but step forward with your left foot. (This is if you are hooping counter-clockwise, which is how my roommate and I do it. Reverse everything if you're gonna go the other way.) newlinechar  newlinechar Start hooping. Don't 'hula'. You pretty much just want to do a back-and-forth pelvic thrust. No side-to-side motion. You want the hoop to hit your body on your left hip bone and your right love-handle. newlinechar  newlinechar Try this for 20 minutes. You WILL get it. Once you get the basic hoop motion, you can start spinning in place (both directions! Very important! With the hoop AND against the hoop), and once you can spin, you can begin learning tricks, like the vortex.

Developmental biology time! The vaginal canal is a column of ring-shaped muscles called the pubococcygeal muscles. It's quite literally the outer part of the penis, only inverted.  newlinechar  newlinechar The muscles can become 'loose' over time via repeated exercises for that purpose. But it can easily return to its original size, or even smaller (to an extent, of course... physical limitations and all), by doing different exercises that strengthen/increase the size of the muscles (read- Kegels), When the muscles grow, the circumference of the vaginal canal decreases, making a 'tighter' feeling vagina.  newlinechar  newlinechar Since the vagina is a muscle, that muscle strength is subject to the same factors that your other muscles are related to. Diet, exercise, genetics, general health, advanced age (read- 70 years and higher) and so on.  newlinechar  newlinechar So yes, a promiscuous woman can easily have a tighter vagina, if she does Kegels regularly. She could, in theory, be tighter than a woman who is a virgin, but has never done Kegels.

I'm from a small town of less than 20k. Everyone knows everyone. For some reason, the town has produced quite a few athletes and well connected professionals. There was a celebrity golf tournament going on one weekend, and they somehow managed to pull Michael Jordan as one of the celebrities.  This was years and years ago when he was still married to his wife.  Well, this tournament is a HUGE thing for the town, especially with Michael Jordan participating. He drove by the school I was attending and waved to everyone out of his limo window. Kids went apeshit.  newlinechar  newlinechar Here's where it gets lovely. There was a 24 hour cafe that we would tend to hang out at in the evenings. Small town, not much else to do.

I whisper into the phone for mom to come and pick me up and BRING THE DAMN CAMERA. I make my way back to my table of friends and see this fucking 'sports hero' with one girl on this lap and the other kissing all over his neck. Neither are his wife.

I once got called for a 'Server is down' issue where a dude had installed Norton on his PC, even though all our PCs had Nod32 installed on them.

In no way do retrospective observations negate the validity of prior intelligence at the time of its reception.  newlinechar  newlinechar The consequences of the dissemination of biological weapons/technology were almost objectively too serious a risk to take.

While some rapists might also suffer from mental illnesses and poor impulse control, these are not necessarily factors that cause rape.

VINTAGE! Wait, this is ODB... FERMENTED!
This topic gets me on rant mode, so I'ma gonna rant away. newlinechar  newlinechar One thing that astounds me about people and the internet in general is the failure to comprehend that there can be more than one cause for things. newlinechar  newlinechar 'She should have watched her drink' is often conflated with 'She should have HAD to watch her drink' and thus people get angry at telling women they should be careful, as if that takes responsibility off the people who abuse them. newlinechar  newlinechar 'Offensive people are everywhere, it's best to get over it' gets replaced with 'Offensive people are everywhere, and that's how it should be.' newlinechar  newlinechar And on the flip side of that same coin, 'People shouldn't get offended when I say things that sound racist because I'm not racist' is another great example.  You're right, I shouldn't presume that every joke you state is a moral stain on your character.  But guess how it really works. newlinechar  newlinechar 'Male teachers should not be alone in offices under 16' is another example.  Maybe in a fair and just world you wouldn't have to proactively prove your innocence, but you're an idiot if you think you can do otherwise. newlinechar  newlinechar The advice I would give to grumpy santa (if he asked, which I don't think he would of me) is how to deal with an unfair reality.  It in no way justifies the reality. newlinechar  newlinechar I wear clean cut suits and forcibly remove all traces of 'blackness' from my speech when I'm in business, because it means people take me more seriously.  I use a very different style when I call family.  I would advise anyone who wants to rise the corporate ladder to do the same.  Should it be this way?  Aww hell no!  I should be able to say 'Girl what?  These numbers are some BULLSHIT!' and not have people think I'm an idiot.  Sadly, it doesn't work that way. newlinechar  newlinechar If I could get everyone on the internet to take a breath and go 'things have more than one cause' and 'the way things are is not the same as the way things ought to be' the internet would be a kinder place for communication. newlinechar  newlinechar Also, if I could have a magical flying pony, I would be very happy.
Those are I'm sure legitimate problems, but when you look at the pay check, you have to realize there are professions where people have to deal with a lot of unwarranted shit and make far less money (social worker comes to mind).
I disagree, but the relative strength/weakness of the North's forces is irrelevant when considering their allies. Iraq didn't have China backing it up. The worst fighting that the US experience in the Korean War came after MacArthur met 300,000 Chinese soldiers after crossing the Yalu river. Part of what keeps the Koreas apart is China. [But I will say that the North Korean military isn't a paper tiger.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_korea#Military)

The continuation of the die roll is not optional and state based effects take place immediately (that is to say if you kill a creature in the middle of the ability, it immediately goes to the graveyard and becomes untargetable for future instances), so if riven is the only creature left in play, she is forced to target herself. newlinechar  newlinechar Rarities are EXTREMELY important. A benchmark of an experienced designer is being able to assign rarities to cards based on effect. That being said, I do concede its one of the harder things to REALLY familiarize oneself with. I've been following magic design for almost 12 years and I still struggle with it at times. newlinechar  newlinechar The biggest thing you need to remember when designing these things is, rather than trying to create entirely new effects to match flavor, try to dig up existing card abilities that would be appropriate for the card.
Sorry realism has no place for discussion in mw3. Might as well get rid of respawning as well since that isn't possible either.

How has Flacco been better?

You throw any top tier korean into a tournament and they have a chance to win it. The difference between zenio and puma is that PuMa was (TSL) and now is (EG) on teams willing to fly him out to tournaments. I didn't hear about oGs paying for Zenio or anyone else to fly out to mass tournaments except when SK decided to sponsor MC/NaDa. newlinechar  newlinechar Would Zenio win as much as PuMa? We'll never know till he starts attending just as many LAN tournaments as PuMa and other top koreans and hopefully Liquid sends him out in 2012.

It's only a rumor I herd. I haven't herd anything official from Paul himself. I hope he serves two terms. My guess would be he would serve one term out of principle. Like Washington. But hopefully I'm wrong. We need this man for 8 years. Not just 4.
Ice Cube was worth ~$150 million long before his sitcom. Get fucking real, he's a grown man. He doesn't live in Compton anymore.
Something close to that. newlinechar  newlinechar But it's more like waiting all day at work knowing at some point in the day I will cry, coming home, taking a shower, eating dinner, little bit of personal internet stuff, sitting alone in my living room, maybe have a beer or two, crack open another, watch a bit more television until something reminds me of him. newlinechar  newlinechar Then that's when all hell breaks loose. newlinechar  newlinechar The first year I probably cried 2 hours straight.  But this year will be the sixth year since he's been gone so it will likely be in the 20 to 30 minute mark.  I know I'm going to cry, I just never know what it is will trigger it. newlinechar  newlinechar Hell, maybe I have to go into my basement to get something and see his guitar in the corner.  He had no will, so my grandparents told people just to take what they wanted, all I wanted was that guitar and one Zippo from his collection.  I was offered the deed to the house but I didn't want to live there or have to deal with selling it, because, I'd have to go back in the house to show people around. newlinechar  newlinechar My grandparents, his parents insisted I take the entire Zippo collection though which was nice of them.  I just wanted one. newlinechar  newlinechar Then irony for me came full circle when they asked me if I wanted one of his guns.  To be honest, up until then I didn't know he owned a gun, let a long guns. newlinechar  newlinechar I have a few guns for protection purposes and the occasional shooting range trip with my friends.  I don't want a gun that my uncle could possibly once held in his hand contemplating whether to kill himself or not.

Sorry, I didn't mean to offend and yes I was just going off on a tangent. Unfortunately, I'm behind a computer screen so you can't see the emotional aspects of my argument, but the reason I spoke of the hivemind opinion, which I believe we both agree has a strong negative connotation, of libertarians first was for me to connect with you, and to show that I'm willing to take criticisms on libertarian ideals, and I apologize if you thought that was an attack on Kucinich himself, whom I do admire myself. As for your previous statement, I do agree that there are fundamental differences among libertarians and progressives. I remember I read on r/progressive someone state that libertarians and progressives are at 'polar opposites' of the political spectrum.

No, I'm saying that the stereotype is a hyperbole, not some single individual. There is no specific public figure that comes to mind, while there *are* publicly militant antitheists.
1.) Kyle. Long story-short, he is mentally handicapped, harasses female co-workers and masturbates in public. He comes in without a guardian. Management won't kick him out of the store because he's disabled. Whenever someone reports him, they 'can't find him.'  newlinechar  newlinechar 2.) Paul the angry old man. Angry old man wears the same dirty clothes everyday and threatens the young girls that work the cash registers. He's threatened to send 'his boys' to kill a 17 year old employee multiple times. He's still allowed in the store. newlinechar  newlinechar 3.) Bertie and Cody: The old lady with the chihuahua service dog. She's just awesome and puts the poor thing in her scooter and he looks like he's sick of dealing with her. It's adorable though.  newlinechar  newlinechar 4.) Lisa, the down-syndrome girl that does nothing but have internal conversations with herself, but vocalizes them in public. She doesn't buy anything, but walks around the store for several hours talking to herself. I'm assuming she might have a touch of dementia. She doesn't have anybody with her, ever. I assume she comes from the same group home as Kyle since they are always in at the same exact time. I'm actually pretty worried they're just dropping people off at our store as a baby-sitting service. Lisa is completely harmless though. newlinechar  newlinechar 5.) Duke, the homeless man. He runs around the store screaming at associates that he could do their jobs better (he's usually drunk.) He smells of beef jerky and camp-fire smoke, and the smell lingers for hours.  newlinechar  newlinechar Also, to the downvotes... I assume it's because of Kyle and Lisa. We're a retail shop, not a place where you can just abandon the significantly disabled for several hours, and then come back later. Our only resource is to call the police if they start throwing things or hurting people. We have NO idea who to contact and how to deal with situations like these and we aren't sure which group home in the area is abandoning them. I'm not being hateful. I taught special education, and this is dangerous as hell. Kyle especially is not capable of being on his own and has cornered people while fondling himself.  newlinechar

There is an unbalanced force of air on the opposite side of your hand.  newlinechar  newlinechar 'Suction' is actually an emergent phenomenon, it isn't a real force.

Mario revolutionized gaming and was a huge staple in the childhoods of thousands, thus making it a large pop culture icon. newlinechar  newlinechar Angry Birds, on the other hand, is a completely unoriginal timewaster.  It may be fun, but in the grand scheme of things there's really nothing special about it. newlinechar  newlinechar Edit for clarity: I'm not even a part of the Mario generation.  I'm not some old guy bitching about how things back in 'my day' were better--I just think the Angry Birds thing is getting out of hand.
I pirate the newest Doctor Whos, yes, and I pirate episodes of discontinued shows (older Doctor Who, for example) and other things I can't find on Netflix or Hulu. Some of the music I listen to is also not available through ITunes or Amazon, so I'll pirate that as well.

I'd give you 94 and 97 as uneven match-ups, but those others are pretty typical match-ups for most bowl games.

Whatever you use, let it dry first! You just want tacky, not permanently stuck down. Super 77 is monster stuff, it'll stick solid when wet, or when applied to another surface with S77 on it (even dried &amp; tacky.) newlinechar  newlinechar Unlike mrd, I have gotten decent results from the Elmer's stuff. Super 77 is what I see most artists using. newlinechar  newlinechar If no adhesive is available/desirable, I use a wooden shim or paint stirrer to hold the stencil down (fingers stick!)  Then use short, quick zaps at a right angle to the stencil to get a clean line without underspray. If you have an edge that's picking up and you spray in long, sustained hose-downs, more paint sneaks under the stencil and fogs the edge lines. Sometimes that's kind of cool... the 'stencilled look.' newlinechar  newlinechar Play around. That's the best way to learn! newlinechar  newlinechar I only use card stock/poster board for simple, quick stuff. (background shapes, etc.) I usually use plastic sheet for designs that take me more than 15 minutes to cut. I've been using the $.79-.99 EXIT / FOR SALE -type signs from Home Depot. Looking for larger sheets that are affordable. newlinechar  newlinechar Plastic sheet holds up to paint &amp; bleach, doesn't absorb stuff, and is easy to cut. I like it.
The word is more applicable than you might thing. Confidence in something is faith.

Hitchens made a similar argument in his book and it ruined the book for me. To a very large extent Stalin enjoyed the power he had not because of any kind of a 'cult of the Dear Leader', but because of fear. He killed his own citizens by the millions. Of course, it had nothing to do with atheism and to claim that it was his atheism that drove him is insane. But to twist definitions of atheism and religion to the point that the regime under Stalin was religious is a bit disingenuous.

You match the employer contribution because it's free money. Whatever your investment would gain or lose on its own, your initial contribution is bolstered by whatever the company throws in. As an example: my company matches 100% of my contribution, up to 5% of my salary. So when I throw in my 5%, I'm effectively investing 10%, immediately doubling my total contribution. newlinechar  newlinechar But 401ks tend to have higher expense ratios and far fewer options for investing your money. So after you get the free money, your retirement funds work harder for you in an IRA. newlinechar  newlinechar *But* you can only invest up to $5k in an IRA each year (depending on your adjusted gross income). So once you've reached your max, then you should invest back into your 401k, which has a higher maximum. While it has faults, it's still a tax-sheltered investment for your retirement.

I know what it feels like to find a subreddit way after things have been discussed, so let's debate.  :)  I'm with you, I think they should've been working on getting more cars to the initial camp.  Even if it's just a one-way trip and they plan on abandoning them at the camp site, it would be a shitload safer for everyone to be sleeping in SUVs or RVs.  The only zombie preparation I saw was some cans on strings around the camp. newlinechar  newlinechar However, it seems like the only people that left the camp were the ones running to Atlanta for supplies.  Lori told Shane that they should've put a sign up on the road telling people to avoid Atlanta when they heard Rick broadcasting on his radio, but Shane said they hadn't had time.  If they can't put out a simple sign, they wouldn't have time to look around for new cars. newlinechar  newlinechar On the other hand, the group running to Atlanta could try to take a vehicle or two every time on their way back.  It seems like they didn't think of that until Rick came along, which I find unlikely.

I'd say 10% means pretty bad service, 15% is fine and 20% is good. newlinechar  newlinechar And yes, when $2.99 actually means $3.43 or whatever, it's really annoying but your brain sort of gets used to mentally adding it.

...ex used to do that in front of me; she was very comfortable with herself...and jeez, she could clear a room with her farts: they could safely be classified as biological warfare (I swear, I think once I woke up from a coma and five minutes before, I was holding up a conversation)...she liked to ask me to accompany her when she wanted to go pee and continue talking with the door open while she aggressively attempted to erode the porcelain and even on rare occasions (she suffered from constipation sometimes) she'd beg me to stay while she practiced giving birth but most times I'd retire well away from that olfactory numb-zone...still, I drew the line at the point when she wanted to share my vortex-opening moments with her; I'm sorry but the concentration needed at those times transform my face until it's unrecognizable as human...I didn't want to put her through that...

How does it benefit bad players more than good players? For example a noob can spray-n-pray and a veteran can do the same thing. The veteran will most likely shoot accurately but they still have the same options. HC mode does not intentionally benefit a specific type of player. Although if anyone benefited from just the mode it would be veterans because noobs would be more likely to get more suicides from the increased fall damage.

If we can assume US lead air superiority, which is no small assumption because of the proximity and possible involvement with China, the artillery strikes can be minimized.

True, religion has done fuck-tonnes to harm humanity as a whole, but ignorance has a substantial amount to do with it. Although extreme religion does bring a lot of ignorance. But religion has also helped humanity, one example is monasteries, Irish in particular, preserving much of ancient western books after the fall of the roman empire. without them, a lot of books would have been lost and the 'dark' ages would have been a whole lot darker

Because by lumping everything together they can force the president to sign.

Yes! I was taught how to drink responsibly by someone and I was able to get away with drinking at home (even though I technically wasn't allowed to drink but my parents didn't know). newlinechar  newlinechar I'm still not of legal drinking age even though I've been drinking for so long, but I feel that I am a very responsible drinker. I've never blacked out. I've never driven drunk. I've never gotten myself into a situation I didn't want to be in. I've puked from drinking too much before, but that hasn't happened in years now. I basically have learned my limit. I know not to mix alcohol with opiates and other drugs. I prefer to drink at home, where I know that I'm safe. I don't drink too frequently either.  newlinechar  newlinechar Overall, I am very glad that I had someone in my life who taught me to drink the right way. Also, I didn't feel that I had to take every opportunity there was to get drunk because I basically had access to alcohol at all times, which I believe decreased the frequency of my drinking.

There was this film festival in my neck of the woods a few years ago,  where Matt Damon was showcasing his new film. Unfortunately the town is pretty windy, and there's lots of lightening.

From simple.wikipedia.org -  newlinechar  newlinechar Conductors usually beat time with their right hand. This leaves their left hand free to show the various instruments when they have entries (when they start playing) or to show them to play louder or softer. Most conductors have a stick called a “baton”. It makes it easier for people at the back of large orchestras or choirs to see the beat. Other conductors prefer not to use a baton. A conductor stands on a small platform called a “rostrum”. newlinechar To be a good conductor is not easy. It is not just a question of giving a steady beat. A good conductor has to know the music extremely well so that they can hear any wrong notes. They need to be able to imagine exactly the sound they want the orchestra to make. They also have to communicate this to the orchestra so that they know what the conductor wants. Some conductors speak very little during their rehearsals. They make everything clear through the way they conduct. newlinechar  newlinechar In short, they are showing the musicians the beat of the song, and telling different sections when it's time for them to get louder or softer, or pointing out whether or not they are too loud or two soft, among many other things.

Agree. newlinechar  newlinechar I'd see an explanation along these lines: atheists tend to be critical thinkers who don't enjoy marching in step as the religious do. Herding cats, kinda thing. Jonathan Haidt does talks where he explains how 'herd mentality' tends to be part of the set of values of GOP/Christian/Conservative folks, and not of Liberal/freethinking people like us. EDIT: Most of us, sorry. I think that's a reasonable assumption. newlinechar  newlinechar I think being better organized might help with gaining and applying political and legal power. The FFRF, American Atheists and others, including Reddit to some extent, are helping a bit with this. But what grows atheism is the growing lack of faith among the religious, and that's proceeding on the efforts of individuals too, and in fact the most potent force in our favor are socio-economic factors that are effective with or without our help. Gregory Paul argues that modern corporatism is instrumental in dismantling religion in the US.

It kind of works both ways. You're being needlessly hostile to an earnest recommendation because you wouldn't want to be an 'elitist hipster d-bag' (it's alright, you can cuss). I watched Pulp Fiction when I was like 14, and because I hadn't seen many films I probably would have pegged it as my favourite movie. This is the case for a lot of people. I've seen more movies now and while Pulp Fiction is a far cry from the best, I recognize that it helped me gain an interest in cinema. I was turned on to my favourite director, Sam Fuller, because Tarantino is always citing him as an influence.  newlinechar  newlinechar So yeah, Al_X_Gore is right to assume that Pulp Fiction is a favourite movie for people who don't watch movies. He's not being condescending; he's probably been there before. The worst thing you can do is write off his recommendations as elitist, which are all pretty popular and critically acclaimed among cinephiles by the way. He's just trying to help.

If an animal is given a happy life, and killed with one shot to the head leading to instant and painless death, while it may not be what you want for yourself, it is a much more humane way to raise animals is dispatch with them to make meat. newlinechar  newlinechar In a perfect world we'd all get our ways, but there are many people who eat meat and they will not reverse course.

Based on most of the home schooled kids I've met, that is not that crazy of an assumption.
All metals have microscopic holes (future cracks) in them just from the way that physics works -- even if they're carefully manufactured. There are roughly three reasons why there are holes in metals: holes around foreign atoms in the metal, holes formed when metallic grains grow into each other, and then holes existing due to the laws of thermodynamics requiring everything to have a bit of entropy. newlinechar  newlinechar You can see how a metal atomic lattice has imperfections in it due to reasons 1&amp;3 [here](http://www.tf.uni-kiel.de/matwis/amat/def_en/defekte_alte_uebersicht.gif). newlinechar  newlinechar When metals cool from their liquid form, they have to start solidifying around something. Usually that something is foreign matter in the liquid. If there is no foreign matter, then it starts solidifying at the solid surface of the container that it's in. The first parts to cool down from liquid to metal form a grain nucleus. This grain grows until it encounters other grains. They look like [this](http://knowledgepublications.com/doe/images/DOE_Material_Science_Grains_And_Boundries.gif). newlinechar  newlinechar Whenever your material is bent, compressed, pulled, etc, the grains within the metal shift. The imperfections, the holes, etc, within a grain start getting pushed out of the grain to the grain boundary. The crack at the grain boundary keeps slowly growing until in a very short period of time (something like 1-5% of the total lifetime of the part) the crack growth jumps and if it's not caught in time, the part splits in half through that crack.  newlinechar  newlinechar Anyway, vibrations due to air resistance and decompression cause the parts to fail :D

You also have to remember that around the time that NWA was formed, Ice Cube was attending a technical college to study architectural drafting.

All rappers are fake by the very definition of the fact that they aren't actual gangsters, and even if they were, they aren't anymore. Also, saying that someone is distancing themselves from the ganagster lifestyle  makes them 'a fake' is basically like saying that being a gangster is a good thing, which obviously it's not.

Zero challenge at all. Deus Ex: HR is guilty of this. I thought that the hardest difficulty would at least be SOMEWHAT challenging, but no, the only way to play it is stealth.

Extremely relevant. Think of it like this: prior to the universe's definite existence, we can assume that the fundamental properties of physics that we know about (gravity, strong nuclear, etc) didn't exist due to the extreme nature of the location our universe was contained in. Mathematically, this is sound. The only way to understand the physical nature of the universe in such an extreme situation is through quantum science. Many quantum events do not obey causality and are, therefore, causeless. It is possible that the Big Bang was itself causeless, merely a quantum fluke that happened to produce the universe. newlinechar  newlinechar No, I don't know if I'm completely right. I could be, but more likely I'm not. I'm just one person. I recommend looking up studies and papers on the subject. I'm sure you may be able to find some reputable scientific journals that talk about the matter. Just try Google!

I have a funny story out of it, though. Because my dad was effectively cut off then, and my mom had zero money to start with, they had a hard time for a few years especially with my mom in law school. So one day, my dad gets an email from one of his great-uncles asking him for lunch. He's a hungry mid-twenties guy, so he goes. Of course, this is also the first time that anyone from his family had spoken to him since the wedding, so he was happy for that too. They had a great lunch at a super expensive New Orleans restaurant, and at the end of the meal, as my dad was leaving, my great-great-uncle shook his hand, told him he made a good choice and he was proud of him, and then handed him a check for fifty thousand dollars and told him not to tell his parents. 
I'm sorry to hear this, but I almost gifted him a game, so I'm glad to see this. Only a small consolation, but want something for like $5 on todays steam sales?
I've been in a situation similar to yours, and the most important thing I've learned is that the more local you go, the more likely you are to get help. Don't look towards the federal government; you are much more likely to get help and answers from the financial office at a local clinic. That's where I would start if I were you. Many of them have sliding fee scales based on income, or there are county-level programs for low-income people, etc. Keep trying, you'll most likely have to make it through the weekend before you can do anything...

i just want to leave this comment right here.  this thread has been totally hijacked by morons (i mean Mauve_Cubedweller). newlinechar  newlinechar a bill requires two passes through Congress for a veto to be overridden.  it has to be passed the first time, vetoed, and then passed through Congress again, with the President's objections having been considered. newlinechar  newlinechar here is what Article 1, Section 7 of the Constitution says about vetoes: newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Every Bill which shall have passed the House of Representatives and the Senate, shall, before it become a Law, be presented to the President of the United States; If he approve he shall sign it, but if not he shall return it, with his Objections to that House in which it shall have originated, who shall enter the Objections at large on their Journal, and proceed to reconsider it. If after such Reconsideration two thirds of that House shall agree to pass the Bill, it shall be sent, together with the Objections, to the other House, by which it shall likewise be reconsidered, and if approved by two thirds of that House, it shall become a Law.  newlinechar  newlinechar Obama, instead of vetoing this atrocious law and requiring the bill to be forced through with his 'Objections,' simply signed the bill into law and made an unconstitutional signing statement in an attempt to excuse his actions.  if he had vetoed it, he could easily have made a statement to the people that could have prevented the bill from being passed at all, and pushed for, say, another defense budget bill to be passed - one that did not strip us of rights that we've held as totally inviolable for the last 234 years. newlinechar  newlinechar this is not 'clever political manuevering by the Republicans.'  Obama chose to pass this affront to our human rights, of his own will.  in fact, the Obama administration reportedly [pushed for the bill to allow for indefinite detention of Americans](http://www.thenewamerican.com/usnews/politics/10170-obama-admin-pushed-for-indefinite-detention-provision). newlinechar  newlinechar there is no defense for what he did here.  even with a signing statement.  both the NDAA and the signing statement are unconstitutional.  Obama has violated his oath of office and betrayed all of you.   newlinechar  newlinechar i almost threw up when i saw how many upvotes Mauve_Cubedweller got.  this is the worst shit that happens on reddit - when political mythology gets upvoted to the top, and all the correct explanations get ignored and downvoted.   newlinechar  newlinechar shame on everyone on this site who upvotes total bullshit just because it reaffirms what they already believe.  we're trying to have a revolution over here, jackasses. newlinechar  newlinechar ----- newlinechar  newlinechar edit: just to be clear on this a thousand times over, the 'editing' of this video (the video was *cut around the edges, but not spliced together*) does not inaccurately depict what happened.  Carl Levin, the co-sponsor of the bill and head, with John McCain, of the Armed Services Committee, directly stated that the Obama administration had asked for the provision protecting American citizens from indefinite detention to be removed.  this section of the final version of the bill - section 1021(e) - does NOT protect American citizens from the indefinite detention provisions: newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; 'Nothing in this section shall be construed to affect existing law or authorities relating to the detention of United States citizens, lawful resident aliens of the United States, or any other persons who are captured or arrested in the United States.'  newlinechar  newlinechar as this passage only appears, to begin with, in a section with the following heading: newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; SEC. 1021. **AFFIRMATION OF AUTHORITY OF THE ARMED FORCES OF THE UNITED STATES TO DETAIN COVERED PERSONS PURSUANT TO THE AUTHORIZATION FOR USE OF MILITARY FORCE.** newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; (a) IN GENERAL.—**Congress affirms that the authority of the President to use all necessary and appropriate force pursuant to the Authorization for Use of Military Force (Public Law 107–40; 50 U.S.C. 1541 note) includes the authority for the Armed Forces of the United States to detain covered persons (as defined in sub- section (b)) pending disposition under the law of war. (b)** COVERED PERSONS.—A covered person under this section is any person as follows: (1) A person who planned, authorized, committed, or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11, 2001, or harbored those responsible for those attacks. (2) A person who was a part of or substantially supported al-Qaeda, the Taliban, or associated forces that are engaged in hostilities against the United States or its coalition partners, including any person who has committed a belligerent act or has directly supported such hostilities in aid of such enemy forces. newlinechar  newlinechar the bill explicitly states that Congress affirms that this indefinite detention ability **already exists** - meaning it is NOT affected by a statement that says 'Nothing in this section shall be construed to affect existing law.'  technically, this is illegal, null and void, for a ton of reasons to begin with - for Fifth Amendment violations, most vitally, and also for the fact that you can't retroactively create a law.

It's not the record of the team, it's the scheme. And Rodgers still played well. But Hali was up his ass all game with a base rush and even with injuries, the Chiefs have well-coached DBs who play their scheme well. newlinechar  newlinechar What surprised me is that the Chiefs were able to score on you. I was figuring you guys would get 23 points or so. What I didn't count on was the Chiefs getting almost that many and you guys falling short. Any game where you hold the Packers to under 30 is a success, but outscoring them is hard.

Well like i said, the bulk of the gameplay is training your character in in the 'wilderness' which consists of 100 or so different areas (different sized grids where mobs spawn), that get progressively harder as you go up in level.  newlinechar  newlinechar You spawn by moving on the map either east/west or north/south or combinations of that. And there are chests to find to unlock with keys that drop from mobs. There are gold and gem drops, gems are used to enhance weapons.  newlinechar  newlinechar Every grid is a plot of land that can be taken over by any player (using keys) and some plots can have a village built (using a foundational stone that can be found rarely as a drop). Mines can be built in villages as well. Items such as weapons, helms, shields, boots, gloves and armors drop randomly and they can either be regular, rare, legendary or ultimate each having consecutively more sockets dependng on level. Every mob can also be a regular or have a +4 elemental damage (earth, liquid, fire, lightning). newlinechar  newlinechar  There is also a flag that spawns randomly in the first 30 or so lands that when picked up gives the finder 20% spawn bonus for 20 minutes, and then is automatically dropped and spawned somewhere else. (picking up the flag is also a source of points in a capture the flag competition that goes on between guilds.)  newlinechar  newlinechar

I'm a Christian who regularly lurks and posts r/atheism.  Do you think this person will care if I tell them as much?  My faith has been enriched by r/atheism, because this subreddit forces me to think critically about it.  You haven't converted me, or, frankly, tried all that hard *to* convert me.  You provide support for people who are also atheist as a primary goal, and a place to vent and speak without being bothered by religious mumbo-jumbo.  I can vouch for that.  Should I bother?

I remember always liking Jimi Hendrix, and alwasy hearing he was the best, a super psychadelic monster that was invincible, and I believed it to some degree, but I guess I had just never totally understood the utter reverence that so many people had for him. newlinechar  newlinechar One day, I met up with some friends at the beach who were all tripping, and one of them casually asks if I want to as well. It was a beautiful sunny day on the San Juans in Washington, on a rocky coast with seals dipping in and out, and starfish everywhere. I decided to do it. Well, after spending some time with them, the sun started to go down, and they all began to head on, but I realized my trip was just beginning. I made my way home alone, decided to play some music as the trip took hold and thus began my moment with Jimi. newlinechar  newlinechar I made my way slowly into my friend's room, which was still somewhat dark. I could hear things crawling and creaking on my peripherals, my vision swam with color and things gently breathed all around me. I sat down the couch and saw my roomie's guitar hooked up to the amp. I grabbed it, and in so doing touched his computer which had been left on. Immediately, a Jimi Hendrix playlist that he had been jamming along with began to play, the guitar already set in tune, with perfect crunch. I looked up, and lo and behold the moonlight had begun streaming through a window covered by a cloth wall hanging of Jimi hendrix himself.  newlinechar  newlinechar His lines, his rhythms, his playing suddenly all made totaly sense to me. He weaves this incredible psychadelic pattern that is amazing colorful and delicate. You can hear two or even three gutair parts weaving in and out of his playing effortlessly while he plays. It drives itself directly to your core, and explodes with joy and light.  newlinechar  newlinechar I don't know how long I was there playing with Jimi, but I'll never forget it, it really opened my eyes to what Psychadelic music really was, and the power music can have over a person who has a gift like that. newlinechar  newlinechar Luckily, there are MANY wonderful musicians with that gift.

I disagree that they could retain citizens, I think 1021(e) makes that pretty darn clear, but the problem is, that's law for you.  Just look at the debate around the phrasing of the second amendment.  This is why there's a supreme court that is responsible for saying what the proper reading of a text is, even if they change their minds (which they do, given enough time). newlinechar  newlinechar SCOTUS has stated that it doesn't see indefinite detention of citizens as constitutionally possible, so if a President tried that, the challenge would very likely be a fairly straight forward affair.  If you're worried that every branch wants to imprison people indefinitely then no law (nor constitutional construct) will ever stop them from doing so.

All the cops around here are the same, the vast majority of them being gun nuts. newlinechar  newlinechar I recall one story of a guy that was moving, and he had part of his collection filling up his car's trunk.  As luck would have it, he got a flat tire somewhere on the interstate in this state.  It was late at night, and to get to his spare tire he had to empty out his trunk, which was completely packed with guns.  A KY State trooper pulled up behind him and was holding his flashlight so that the guy could see while he changed his tire.  The guy told the state trooper he had a big pile of guns from his collection in the grass on the side of the road, the trooper looked at them with his flashlight for a second and then said 'alright' and put the light back on the tire.  After the tire change was done, the trooper said 'have a nice night,' got back in his cruiser and drove off. newlinechar  newlinechar I got pulled over once, and the first question the cop asked was whether I had a weapon on me because he saw my Sig Sauer sticker on the back of my truck.  I said 'No, not tonight.'  I must have blanched when he asked me about it, though, because he laughed and said 'Nothin' wrong with likin' guns.  I'm just gonna run your license.'  Let me off with a warning.

Passing offense between the 90's and today is not that much different despite all the hoopla that is being spouted about Brees, Brady and Rogers and the seasons they are having and this 'year of the QB' bullshit.  You had guys like Marino, Bledsoe, and Favre doing similar things then.  1995 I believe had passing teams that compare to the great ones of today.  The 49ers were one of those teams, with Young + Grbac combining for nearly 5000 yards even then and Rice catching 120+ passes for 1800+ yards.  Outliers.  newlinechar  newlinechar The true test will be how this Niner team plays on the road in the playoffs.  Aikman pimped it.  So did a young Brady (winning twice in AFC Championship games on the road in Pittsburgh).  Believe it or not, Montana only won ONE..... ONE playoff road game.  Bears, January 89.  That's it.  Young was winless on the road in the postseason.  A lot of people forget the Niners even in the glory years SUCKED on the road in the playoffs, with Young AND Montana.   newlinechar  newlinechar If Smith can do what they couldn't, it would immediately put him up there in my book.  If the Niners can win playoff road games consistently under Harbaugh, I would be willing to put this team up with the others as just as good if they can actually win out.  And I believe they can with this defense.

I lived on a farm where this would happen frequently, but it was elk, not deer.

**I APPRECIATE YOUR LIFESTYLES BUT THE THINGS YOU ARE MENTIONING ARE NOT ALL 'NON-MORMON' IS ABOUT** What the church teaches is a separation from the world.

No. This is a false idol, a harbinger of Satan. Those who stand in the shadow of the wicked worshiping, celebrating the day of the pagan will surely meet their doom. We are all sinners and we all deserve eternal punishment in hell for our sins. It is what awaits us when we shed our mortal coil and our souls leave this temporary plane. newlinechar  newlinechar There is hope, however. Our True Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ Almighty, Holy Warrior and Master of all died and was buried and on the third day he rose again from the dead in order to defeat Satan and his prophets of hell. Only by accepting Jesus Christ Almighty into our hearts can we ask God for forgiveness and obtain the gift of everlasting life and happiness in heaven. Without Jesus Christ we will be doomed to be tortured and sodomized by the false lord of the sinner, Satan. Merely accepting Jesus Christ will allow us to escape our punishment. It sounds easy, doesn't it? It really is that simple. Accept Jesus or fuck off and die.

I don't usually drink as is.  I never really saw the point of drinking just to get drunk or 'have a good time'.  Also a lot of alcohol just tastes either the same, like most beers, or very bitter.

You've hinted that communication is difficult with your SO and that he shuts down. You could try alternate means of communicating with him (e-mail, letter, notes) or you can try to prepare yourself so that you when you do address the issue, you can speak with him in a non-emotional way. This will bring the issues to light and hopefully keep yourself from getting emotionally involved because it sounds like he does not have the best tools for communicating about his own feelings, much less yours.

Americans seem to treat the constitution as a biblical scripture with wording from god that shan't be changed. That makes no sense. Look abroad at what works and what doesn't work.

The dice that most people used aren't close to random either. The rounded edges mean that the dice will most likely favor one area over another.

Sweden works because its an area the size of a State. The Constitution was set up to let States make their own programs because it wouldn't make sense for one central government to dictate social policies in 50 small countries. Its how the US ended up with the Defense of Marriage Act that essentially bans gay marriage across the entire country while spitting in the face of States that want to legalize gay marriage. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;I think the founding fathers would've wanted the US population to be creative in continuing the development of a country which they wanted to be the greatest on earth. newlinechar  newlinechar This is why we have Amendments. If the States all agree to give the federal government new powers they get together and change the Constitution.

I agree.  It is important to make the setup and use of VOIP as simple as possible to maximize its adoption within the game and that can be challenging. newlinechar  newlinechar However, I'd say that games like MMOs, such as WoW, lend themselves towards the use text chat and private VOIP servers.  Back when I played WoW, I rarely wanted to talk to a random player and if I did, the gameplay provided me with ample time to type out complex messages.  With members of a guild, that was different; voice became an integral part of socializing and coordinating raids, etc. newlinechar  newlinechar For team FPS games, I often want to tell a random player something and the fast-paced gameplay makes it impossible to type out complex messages (unless I'm staring at the spawn screen).  Being able to bark out a warning or order to another player, even if it's unidirectional because the other player hasn't bothered to set up VOIP, is beneficial to gameplay, in my opinion.

Okay, I hope you're ready for this: newlinechar  newlinechar First and most important, each new speaker should have their own paragraph. For example: newlinechar  newlinechar 'Blah blah blah,' said Mister One. 'Blah.' newlinechar  newlinechar Mister Two rolled his eyes at him. 'Oh, blah blah,' replied Mister Two. newlinechar  newlinechar Anyway, onto the fic. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;The door slammed as the light brown pony ran in, he flipped a bunch of controls, clutching his side.   newlinechar  newlinechar Does the door slam shut or open? Doors can slam open if they hit a nearby wall so you should specify. Also, 'he flipped...' should be its own sentence: '...ran in. He flipped...'   newlinechar &gt; He knew he was lucky to escape with his life. newlinechar    newlinechar It should be 'he had been lucky' because (I can't remember the name of the tense) it's in the past. If you're telling a story that already takes place in the past, and you talk about something that took place before that (past^2), then you need to use 'had.' newlinechar    newlinechar &gt;He looked at his hooves and saw they were glowing slightly.   newlinechar  newlinechar Not sure if I'm being nitpicky, but I think it's 'saw that they were'.   newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; 'not now…'  He muttered,   newlinechar  newlinechar It should be ''Not now...' he muttered,' because the ellipsis (...) is taking the place of a comma (so you could also say 'Not now,' he muttered,') and 'He muttered, but before...' is not a complete sentence. What did he mutter? 'Not now.' Therefore you need to connect the dialogue and the verb.   newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;he exploded into a big flash of light.  Causing his ship to burst into flames from the inside.   newlinechar  newlinechar It should be 'flash of light, causing his...' because that second sentence isn't a complete sentence, and goes with the previous sentence.   newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;what seemed like a new pony stood in his place.   newlinechar Try 'a seemingly different pony stood in his place' or 'what appeared to be a different pony stood in his place.'   newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;'Not good, not good,' As sparks   newlinechar  newlinechar End 'Not good, not good.' with a period, not a comma.   newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;almost at a loss for words   newlinechar  newlinechar Again, end with a period.   newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;'Come on…come on...hold together…hold together….' He pleaded   newlinechar  newlinechar After punctuation should come a space, so 'Come on... come on...' etc would be proper, but I think it'd be better if you just used commas instead. Also, again, ''hold together...' he pleaded' or ''hold together,' he pleaded'.   newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;but it was to no avail as an all to familiar alarm sounded.   newlinechar 'an all-too familiar'   newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Then he spotted a familiar planet, at that point he decided it was no use, and slammed his hooves on the controls and braced himself for impact.   newlinechar  newlinechar Try this: 'But then he spotted a familiar planet, and decided it was no use to try and fix his failing ship. Slamming his hooves against the controls, he braced himself for impact.'   newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; He knew his ship could take another beating, and shouted at the top of his lungs. 'GERANIMO!!!' while he crashed down to the land of Equestria.   newlinechar  newlinechar Try: 'Knowing his ship could take another beating, he shouted a single word as his ship plummeted down towards the land of Equestria: 'GERONIMO!''   newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Her light rose-colored eyes newlinechar  newlinechar Personally, they seem more lavender or light purple to me.   newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;scribbling notes down on pads newlinechar  newlinechar This is worded awkwardly, try 'scribbling in their notepads.' newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;She adjusted her bowtie and began to pack up her cello,  newlinechar  newlinechar That is a sentence by itself. Finish it with a period: 'began to pack up her cello.' newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;'My what pretentious morons with no musical taste what so ever, oh well, the job is as good as mine at least.' She thought to herself.  newlinechar  newlinechar 'My, what pretentious morons with no musical taste whatsoever,' she thought to herself.

&gt;I assumed that if your family had 250 million some that you would have a decent chunk of change, maybe 5 million or so. newlinechar  newlinechar There are two main types of assets, liquid and hard.  newlinechar  newlinechar A liquid asset is something like money. It's immediate, its value won't rise or diminish much between the point in which you bought/exchanged for it and when you sell/exchange it, and it doesn't really matter all that much what the market looks like because it's so low-risk that it's not worth speculating on.  newlinechar  newlinechar A hard asset is something that you invest in for the long haul, like a house or oil. Its value will hopefully rise dramatically, but only over the course of many months/years. You want to make *sure* the value is at its peak when you sell a hard asset because otherwise you're kicking a ball into the stands and yelling 'goal!' newlinechar  newlinechar Coming from a similar background and similar numbers as OP, you don't want liquid assets. If you go back even four decades ago, money had something like five times the purchasing power that it has today. That means that our families would effectively have $50.000.000 rather than $250.000.000. There's a world of difference between those two numbers, so instead of keeping your wealth in something which is guaranteed to tank in value you instead invest the vast majority in hard assets, turning that $250.000.000 into $500.000.000 down the line (even if that $500.000.000 has the same buying power). newlinechar  newlinechar She doesn't seem to like giving specific numbers, but for reference sake my trust fund is only in the upper six digit range. That seems like a lot, but in reality it's going to be enough to emigrate, buy a house, furnish it, and set up a nestegg. My family's liquid assets are likely somewhere in the low eight digit range, even if our net worth (the combined value of all assets) is approaching the mid nines. All of that money is locked down with no hope of ever touching it unless I sell everything you don't want to sell off when I get control over that kind of stuff, and doing so is basically fucking over every subsequent generation for a bit of momentary comfort.  newlinechar  newlinechar

I was really disappointed to see a comic like that reach the top of the thread. And I like to think that humanity is more good than bad. This coupled with the fact that at the time of the post, not a single person explained why rape-jokes are bad in a non 'logical-fallacy' kind of way such as ad-hominem was what motivated to make this throw-away. newlinechar  newlinechar The first post was mostly an experiment to see if Reddit would upvote a clear and well articulated post defending the - or so it appears - quite unpopular stance at [/r/gaming](/r/gaming) of being against rape-jokes. And while some people are going not going to change their mind, there were a lot of people who commented who were genuinely curious about the issue - and that was great. newlinechar  newlinechar What saddened me further is that some people who clearly know that rape-jokes are not a good thing to do, were actually reinforcing people in their wrong beliefs because of personal attacks. The fact is that you have to understanding and kind to potentially make people change their stances, attacking them will simply fortify their belief that the 'other-side-is-wrong' and make it harder for those who want to make this world a better place for all of us. newlinechar  newlinechar Although I think the experience was mostly positive, and while I realize this might not really be the 'theme' of this subreddit, if you believe that you are doing the right thing, be mature about about it instead of shoving ideas down people's throats. Not that long ago I was on the other side of this argument, mainly because brought up in a relatively privileged setting and had no idea about how bad it was. There are actually very few people who are 'bad' people. 
I would have refused. They made the new kids do that.
The money that you put into Roth IRAs can be withdrawn penalty-free, whereas withdrawing from a 401k carries a steep penalty. This effectively makes the Roth a backup savings account / emergency fund, and that's the primary reason people use them over 401ks. As doubleknot said, if you're not using a Roth, then there's not nearly as much of a reason to use an IRA over a 401k.

I remember in an interview with Wenger one year ago said that when Song retrieved the ball he would slow down the game because he had to breathe right again, and was slow with looking for the past, but now he has improved and he manages to help the game flow. But now when i see Ramsey play and when he has the ball, I can't help keep being reminded by  what Wenger said about players slowing down the play of the game, whto him en Ramsey is on the ball - there are very good through ball passes that is available to him which could release Robin if he didn't dwell on the ball and just do a one touch pass. But the Problem is that Ramsey can't see those passes that we can on the stands or on TV.

&gt;When men can become impregnated, carry a baby to term, and give birth - we may have reproductive equality. Until then, biological differences make true equality absolutely impossible. newlinechar  newlinechar All I'm asking is you this to stay consistent. I'm fine with men having no reproductive rights **under this one circumstance:** which is, if the child is her's because it's in her body, then it's her's after birth as well. If a father feels like ditching the kid, it's now his right because it didn't come from his body, and until men can give birth, they don't need to take responsibility for kids.  newlinechar  newlinechar Again, I'm only advocating this to keep it logically consistent. If the man has no right to tell a woman what to do with her body, then she has no right to hold him accountable for what happened in her body. newlinechar  newlinechar If we're all in control of our bodies and only our bodies, then women can't force men to take care of their children. If you don't agree with this, then tell me how you're being logically consistent. That is, how can you apply the logic to women, but not to men.

Vetoing the bill would have been political suicide for 'the spineless prick in the White House.'  The president is already hobbled by Republican opposition in the House and the tenuous edge the Democrats hold in the Senate; vetoing the budget for the American armed forces would play so far into the Republican narratives about wussy Democrats that it would be a holiday for them.  The Republicans could paint Obama as someone who actively wants to weaken America, thereby offending the machismo of conservative hawks and stoking the fear and paranoia that permeates national discourse about terrorism and political Islam.  Clearly, this isn't an accurate picture of Obama at all, but Obama's vast expansion of covert drone wars and presidential detention powers are under- or misreported often enough that the distinction will be lost on the average American voter.  To them, Obama will be the guy who wants the terrorists to hurt America. newlinechar  newlinechar Furthermore, vetoing the bill doesn't energize the Democratic base at all, outside of a handful of the very far-left who believe the military is evil.  In fact, it may alienate more conservative or even moderate Democratic voters who will see 'Obama vetoes military spending bill' all over the news but won't necessarily see why he did so, or the offensive parts of the bill.  Even now, these things are being under-reported in the mainstream media relative to their importance, and I'm willing to bet that whether the average American voter now opposes them is a direct product of how you explain those parts of the bill to him (or her).  Many people will naively assume that only bad guys will be subject to such measures, and since they aren't bad, it's of no consequence to them.  This is the same sentiment that underlies both people's support for better airline security and their disgruntlement about having to actually put up with those measures when they fly.  *I* know I'm not carrying a knife onto the plane, so why do I have to be x-rayed and fondled and stripped half-naked every time I go through security?  Similarly, if *I* know I don't support Al Qaeda, why would I ever get nabbed by the military? newlinechar  newlinechar Furthermore, a veto on principle would not even get him anywhere; assuming he vetoed because he opposed the bill, it would likely have been able to garner the two-thirds majority in both houses needed to override such a veto.  He would have sacrificed enormous political support for both himself and his party for zero gain. newlinechar  newlinechar Basically no politician is a Mr. Smith who will stay true to his core principles and fix the establishment through sheer righteousness.  That's just not how politics works.  Obama's threat of a veto was as much resistance as he could mount without leaving himself exposed.  If playing politics when you're a politician makes you a spineless prick, then I guess Obama is one.  But calling him spineless doesn't change the fact that this bill doesn't really radically change policy Obama had already implemented; it just takes it to a new level.

I don't have children and I absolutely judge parents by their noisy/quiet kids.

True, radio communications are easier and cheaper to use. But the FCC has already reduced the 'public band' to a tiny portion of what was once a wide-open air, and mandates that these bands be used for voice communications only. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Worse, it's quite common for the FCC to find 'rogue' sources of radio transmissions and track them down. Unlike a satellite, a radio tower is not very hard to find. Then they can slap you with huge fines, turn you in to the RIAA, or just black-bag you in the middle of the night. Their choice. (Don't believe me? A guy in my county gave me this advice on building a cell phone repeater antenna: *don't do it.* Apparently they found his antenna, confiscated it, cut *all* wires going into and out of his house, and left him with a note saying 'don't do it again or worse is coming your way.') newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Personally, a satellite wouldn't really be the most cost-effective, but it would be a huge statement to the enemies of free speech - just like Sputnik was to the Americans, a constant reminder over their heads.

Universities are easier to cope with than the corporate world, academics often tend towards eccentricity.

WTF? NO. DYEB?
Yes, but what is considered a launch priority and not is vastly different what from players consider a priority. As for 'months and months' of beta, how early were the betas you were participating in? What was the focus of those betas? Was it on scalability? Quest line coherence? Graphics? While the betas unearthed many, many problems, were they necessarily the problems they were prioritizing to correct? Building games is a very long and arduous process, if your assertion is that 'the problems were known, they should have been fixed by now' then there are two derivative statements that can be made: newlinechar  newlinechar 1) They didn't have enough manpower to address your problem. They were not sitting on their hands, or wasting time. Everyone can agree, I thinkk, that a project of this investment is under a lot of eyes. If we agree that they weren't wasting time, then they were focusing on other priorities. Those priorities could have been scalablity, as everyone has noted, this has been an extremely smooth launch. newlinechar  newlinechar 2) They had enough manpower and chose, specifically, to not address your problem. newlinechar  newlinechar Which of these do you think is more likely?
The 3-5 years of crude estimate, what do you base that on?  I'm not trying to be a dick, but we can't have a discussion based on numbers you pull out of a hat. I don't dispute that we're running out of oil, but everything I've read puts estimates somewhere between your incredibly lowball figure and 20 to 30 years.  Since we're not citing sources to back up our numbers, you can do with my figures what I did with yours. Scoff or consider, dispute or disregard. Either way - without data they are just opinions.  newlinechar  newlinechar I guess the only thing unfair about your reply is that I feel it assumes I am operating with the mind of a child. That's cool though, it's certainly not the worst way someone has talked to me on the internet, or in real life!  I'm adult enough to not sweat it.  newlinechar  newlinechar I understand that resources are finite.  Do you really think I didn't know that?  It's obvious that a model based on perpetual growth can not continue unabated forever.  These are not responses to my feeling that we can pull through, because I don't believe we need MORE CONSUMPTION to pull through. I don't believe that in order to still be 'Us' we have to continue living as we have for the last 30 years. Things can change in unheard of ways almost overnight.   newlinechar  newlinechar Let me ask you, was the world wide web a multi-billion dollar industry 20 years ago?  Did users of web forums have enough political clout to inspire comedians to host rallies?  Could web users wield the kind of clout that causes businesses to backpedal and rush to reverse their support of unpopular legislation?  We both know they didn't. The point of this is that things change.  As I stated before, our culture is in a constant state of flux.  There will always be new businesses, new resources, (physical or intellectual) to be used.  Huge frontiers of new technology are always opening up.   newlinechar  newlinechar It seems to me that you look at us running out of oil as a sign that everything is coming down around us. They sky is falling and everything will end in tragic ruination. I see us running out of oil as an incentive for the brightest creative minds of the world to innovate.  Crisis and adversity drives the creation of new technology and science, which in turn fosters industry and the economy.  newlinechar  newlinechar U.S. hegemony isn't ironclad. Our reign has been short, less than 100 years.  It may have been caustic in some places, but - the average living conditions and lifespan of the average human on Earth is better than it has every been at any point in human history. We're living longer, happier, healthier lives on a global scale.  It is an unprecedented time of prosperity for the human race.  Yeah, there is some fucked up shit going on, but it is *always* getting better.   newlinechar  newlinechar Civilizations do come and go. We are no different. I never said we were. I just said I don't think it's our time. Not yet. A slactivist friend of mine told me 6 months ago he expected to see revolution in the U.S. by the end of the year.  I disagreed, and I still do.  The U.S. has another 40-50 years *minimum* as a leading nation in the world. (notice I didn't say *the* leading nation) This is obviously, as per the constant use of 'I feel,' and 'I think,' all just my opinion. I'm sorry but your stating of basic principles of consumption hasn't swayed my belief, because those things were already factored in.   newlinechar  newlinechar Remember, everyone thinks Rome ruled for 1000 years and then collapsed and was never heard from again.  The truth is that Rome changed a lot. Changed it's name, it's capitol, and it's sphere of influence was drastically reduced.  But the New Roman or *Byzantine* empire still enjoyed success and prosperity for an additional 1000+ years after the fall of the Holy Roman Empire.  Rome's got nothing on us. We aren't done yet. Not by a long shot.

Bullshit. He has the bully pulpit. If any Republicans tried to use the veto against him he could clearly point out that he didn't like the whole GULAG provision and would gladly sign a bill without it. He's trying to blame his **own action** on the Republicans just as he has every other fuckup in his administration. Obamacare wasn't what he wanted, but he still signed it. SOPA won't be what he wanted, but he'll still sign it. He's just found a way to do what he wants and not take any of the blame he deserves. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;To them, Obama will be the guy who wants the terrorists to hurt America. newlinechar  newlinechar You're attempting to blame his actions on a potential reaction of the American voter? That perfectly underscores my characterization of him as a spineless prick.  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Furthermore, vetoing the bill doesn't energize the Democratic base at all, outside of a handful of the very far-left who believe the military is evil. newlinechar  newlinechar I really don't give a shit of what electoral effects he might face for not doing something horribly wrong. Your entire argument seems to hinge on the logic that he might hurt his chances of being re-elected if he doesn't authorize GULAGs and that that should excuse his actions. newlinechar  newlinechar Fuck him. He and any Congressman that voted on this bill have committed treason and should be recalled or impeached at the nearest opportunity.

&gt;This bill has been in the works for a while, and all I've heard from him up until tonight is how it isn't quite powerful enough.

If he had such a brilliant PR team, he wouldn't have let Republicans control the narrative during the 2010 elections. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;I'm not saying he IS power drunk. But it is a position with a lot of temptation. You should look for how he could be planning to bring about tyranny, seeing as how many of his actions have been those of an imperialist. Even if Americans remain unaffected, it's about time we take a stand on this kind of bullshit. newlinechar  newlinechar When things like these are passing with veto proof majorities, not sure how much exactly one can do here. Afterall, it was the freedom loving teapartiers who were supposed to save us from the tyranny and now they are the ones who are doing it.

I agree with you to a point.  I am very happy because of my wife and kids, but very unhappy with my line of work.   I am successful enough to take care of my kids but it is EXTREMELY hard.  One thing can throw us into disarray.  newlinechar  newlinechar For instance, my daughter was diagnosed with Rheumatoid Arthritis.  I have great insurance through my work, but it only covers 80%.  Now my 'success' really means I can't afford proper health care for my child (It's 1000$ an hour to see the Rheumatologist at Children's).   It would be VERY different if I were financially successful.  That's been enough to send my wife back to work early. newlinechar  newlinechar People always say 'oh, you work for a university, you may not get paid well but at least it's low stress and you don't have to work a lot of overtime.'

I always have to defend him, but Tebow is to blame for you hate of Bayless.

Hey look, this guy has found a way to feel superior to both the OP and me! You, too, are a condescending elitist hipster douche bag (I spelled it out for you this time). Am I being needlessly hostile? Probably. This is the internet, enjoy your stay. newlinechar  newlinechar Anyway, allow me to explain my position more thoroughly. You (and Al_X_Gore) cannot assume, based on the limited information that the OP has provided, that he has not seen the films listed by Al_X_Gore. What if he has seen all of the listed films, and Pulp Fiction is *still* his favorite movie? The flawed premise you and Al_X_Gore seem to go by is that Pulp Fiction is somehow an inherently inferior film, and the OP has simply not experienced *truly good* films. This is the exact sentiment that the OP is talking about when he made his post. You and Al_X_Gore have an elitist superiority complex (which I call condescending elitist hipster douche bag syndrome) based on information that has not been provided and is only assumed. newlinechar  newlinechar Now, your final argument, that Al_X_Gore's list of movies are popular and critically acclaimed among 'cinephiles', is completely irrelevant. A favorite movie is a personal, *opinion based* value judgement, and can and often is based off of more than just the merit of a movie's story and aesthetics (which is what a critic may look at). A favorite movie may be a favorite because of the memories that the movie instills in the individual viewer. Maybe he, too, saw it when he was 14, and it is his favorite movie because when he watches it it makes him feel young again. Maybe it reminds him of the thrill of watching movies. newlinechar  newlinechar Keep in mind that the OP did not say that Pulp Fiction is *the best* movie, the most innovative, or the most critically acclaimed movie. Asking what *the best* movie is is very different from asking for a *favorite* movie. This distinction is very important to remember. newlinechar  newlinechar For the record, I don't think that Pulp Fiction is that good of a movie and I think that Tarantino is overrated. And I enjoyed some of the movies on Al_X_Gore's list. But these are my opinions, and I am not going to judge others based entirely on what they list as their favorite movie.

Public schools refer to free schools paid by the state (since schools are a state matter).  This is in contrast with private schools which have a tuition, and those can be subdivided into religious schools (like Catholic schools) and non-religious.  There are also 'magnet' schools or specialized schools (say, aimed at the arts/music/performance) which are usually public, but require a test of some sort to get admitted, but are otherwise free.  Some are homeschooled where parents attempt to teach courses (in the US, many homeschooled children are by religious parents who don't trust the secular system to teach the right values). newlinechar  newlinechar Magnet and similar specialty schools are uncommon, typically found in larger cities where larger populations justify specialized schools (ie, there are enough students that such a school makes sense).

Awesome quote from salon.com about this here's a direct quote: newlinechar  newlinechar It’s perfectly rational and reasonable for progressives to decide that the evils of their candidate are outweighed by the evils of the GOP candidate, whether Ron Paul or anyone else. An honest line of reasoning in this regard would go as follows: newlinechar  newlinechar     Yes, I’m willing to continue to have Muslim children slaughtered by covert drones and cluster bombs, and America’s minorities imprisoned by the hundreds of thousands for no good reason, and the CIA able to run rampant with no checks or transparency, and privacy eroded further by the unchecked Surveillance State, and American citizens targeted by the President for assassination with no due process, and whistleblowers threatened with life imprisonment for “espionage,” and the Fed able to dole out trillions to bankers in secret, and a substantially higher risk of war with Iran (fought by the U.S. or by Israel with U.S. support) in exchange for less severe cuts to Social Security, Medicare and other entitlement programs, the preservation of the Education and Energy Departments, more stringent environmental regulations, broader health care coverage, defense of reproductive rights for women, stronger enforcement of civil rights for America’s minorities, a President with no associations with racist views in a newsletter, and a more progressive Supreme Court. newlinechar  newlinechar Without my adopting it, that is at least an honest, candid, and rational way to defend one’s choice. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar The full article is on the first page or /r ronpaul have a read. it's pretty good.

To be fair, it was accidental. Fines and penalties are usually applied more strongly/harshly when it's clear that the intent was to screw over consumers (cf the Harvey Norman thing that's just come to light). Fining a small fish and chip shop for everything they have and more over something like this just wouldn't be good for anybody, as well as being needlessly harsh (think 'making an example of you'). newlinechar  newlinechar I don't doubt for a second though that the employee in question is going to be thrown under a fucking bus for this, and I'm torn on whether or not they deserve it. On the one hand, accidents happen, regardless of what all the simpering HR goons would have you believe. On the other hand, caustic soda is stored in clearly-marked containers with safety lids - nothing at all like a bulk salt container.

If Newt Gingrich or Mitt Romney gets into office it will be partially your fault. You have no better course of action here. Sure, Obama may suck, but are you really going to risk Gingrich getting the presidency. All you are doing by not voting for Obama is increasing the chances of a much worse candidate to get into office. Everyone who is just going to throw away their vote on this is thinking irrationally. The thing is, flip flopping between the parties every year keeps them alive. The only reasonable choice is to consistently put the lesser of two evils into the white house and let the other party die. Also, you can work for 3rd party candidates at lower levels of office, and you should, but baring Ron Paul (and I'm not saying he is a good choice either) is in the election, your vote should be going towards Obama.

Scoliosis and a bad lower back qualify as 'compelling' reasons to stay away from squats and deads, I think. Hopefully whatever caused your lower back injury is something you're working on rehabbing - speaking from experience, that can take you out of commission on virtually anything if it worsens. I do see squats and deadlifts in your fitocracy log though - what gives? newlinechar  newlinechar I'm surprised that you're able to do pendlay rows, DB squats, shrugs, leg press, etc. given what you've described, too, because those all involve various degrees of spinal loading. newlinechar  newlinechar To answer your questions, 'presses, legs, and pulls' does not in and of itself a good routine make. In a VERY broad sense, you're covering all the bases, but beyond that a lot depends on what type of goals you have. Nearly every routine, regardless of stated goal, will have one or more 'work sets' of a compound movement at heavy weight for few repetitions. Bodybuilding programs will involve a lot more volume (total weight lifted) for the targetted muscles beyond these sets, and are generally broken down more specifically than push/pull/legs (e.g. chest, tris/bis, back, legs, abs/shoulders). Strength-oriented programs will tend towards less total volume and are usually not as subdivided. newlinechar  newlinechar I've probably typed a lot more than I needed to here - at the end of the day, if you're lifting more weight, or the same weight for more repetitions, each time you go to the gym, then your program is not 'useless', at least (and what you're doing is certainly miles better than a lot of 'I came up with this myself!' plans I've seen over the years) - but even if you're not able or willing to switch to one of the well-established lifting routines, you should probably make an effort to structure your training more in the way I've described - centering around one or two compound movements a day at high weight for lower reps, and then assistance work as desired, depending on your goals.

&gt;What evidence exists that it [homosexuality] is not a disorder? newlinechar  newlinechar It's not about if it's a mental disorder or not. It's about WHAT is a disorder or not. A mental disorder can be defined as a a state of mind of a person who can't function in society. Like people who are highly paranoid, people that can't get over physical abuses, people that can't work because of disabilities, etc. When an individual reach a clearly defined state based on objectives criteria, then you can have a consensus about mental disorder.  newlinechar  newlinechar If you look at homosexuality, you can't really say it's the source of any mental or intellectual incapacity. Homosexuals can be depressed because of social stigmata, but they can get over it. In fact, like a lot of problems that arise from individual tastes, choices, interests and what not, homosexuality can be (and I god damned hope) a source of pride, joy and satisfaction like ANY kind of love life. newlinechar  newlinechar In fact, if we let sexuality become an criteria for mental disorders, then obviously, incest should be a case of mental disorder. You sexually abuse your child? You are insane (as opposed to an horrible parent). You like bondage? God damn crazy freak! Anal? Oh god, that IS insane. And don't get me started on those weird ass couchsexuals. newlinechar  newlinechar Mental disorders diagnostics shouldn't be based on subjective criteria. Most of the time, people saying that homosexuality is a mental disorder are either ignorant of the meaning of mental disorder in a medical context or are judgmental. newlinechar  newlinechar /edit newlinechar It's like deciding if a tomato is a fruit or vegetable. Botanist tells us it's a fruit, because it develops from a flower's ovaries and contains seeds. But cooks tells us it's a vegetable because it contain almost no sugars (like normal fruits) and a lot of glutamic acid and aromatic sulfur compounds which makes them great with meat, like other vegetables. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Even the United States Supreme Court has preferred the cook’s definition to the botanist’s. In the 1890s, a New York food importer claimed duty-free status for a shipment of tomatoes, arguing that tomatoes were fruits, and so under the regulations of the time, not subject to import fees. The customs agent ruled that tomatoes were vegetables and imposed a duty. A majority of the Supreme Court decided that tomatoes were “usually served at a dinner in, with, or after the soup, fish, or meat, which constitute the principal part of the repast, and not, like fruits, generally as dessert.” Ergo tomatoes were vegetables, and the importer had to pay. newlinechar  newlinechar There is a infinite cleavage between what you define mental disorder as and what the general consensus of it is. So what do you decide, let psychologists define mental disorder or define it based on your own reflexions?

But your argument against abstinence, which I totally agree with, is that people don't always live up to what they think they'll do. They also don't always use condoms or hormones when they think they should, and pulling out is a hell of a lot more effective than no method at all.

Been there, done that.  (Not that I count IPv6+NAT64 as 'IPv6-Only.') newlinechar  newlinechar IMO, there are two major problems with IPv6-only client networks: lack of IPv6 support in software, and lack of support in hardware devices. newlinechar  newlinechar Browsers and mail clients tend to be fine.  Anything else is a crap shoot -- and by that I'd include VoIP/IM clients (including enterprise-grade VoIP/IM) and games (relevant to IPv6 in the home).  Server-side software tends to be better about support, in my experience. newlinechar  newlinechar On the hardware side, routers (getting better), printers (getting pretty good!), NAS, IP cameras, and of course home entertainment systems (PVRs, stereo equipment, game consoles) are very slow on the IPv6 uptake. newlinechar  newlinechar The situation on both sides improves every year, but IMO the vast majority of networks aren't ready for IPv6-only unless there's a very limited set of software/hardware involved.

No, they needed the stealth whispercopters so that bin Laden's lookouts wouldn't realize the choppers were coming directly to his location. After the initial ground force was landed and the element of surprise was already utilized, two Chinooks were brought into the area to land specialized non-assault troops and to help extract the assaulters after they lost one of their choppers. And believe me, there is *nothing* louder than a Chinook within a mile of you. They are unbelievably loud.

I laughed at that, nicely put :D I've spoken to a few people who have had domestic abuse and we all have zombie apocalypse like plans as to what would happen if he/she broke into the house when we were sleeping.  I know *exactly* where all the heavy objects in my room are and where to hide for an ambush (with the hoover) as he comes up the stairs. newlinechar  newlinechar It's a really strange side effect to all of this that I find it hard to get out of is that I often find myself sleeping fully dressed when I get all panicky, even after this amount of time, because it's in my head that I might have to leap out of bed if he's in the house and kill him before he kills me and takes the children (that was a legit threat, he really meant it as well) and if that happened then I would have to go right to the phone and not move, because I would need the forensics to prove self defence and wouldn't want the police to take me to the station in my pyjamas.  newlinechar  newlinechar I know it's messed up, I know this but they get inside your head like this, if they didn't then I would have walked a long time before I did.

No, despite being mercenaries/military/whatever the hell you want to call them, money's money anyways. To be honest I don't really think that they were actually afraid of communism, they simply wanted something to yell their problems at and my grandfather seemed to be attached to that.

I have used just about any type of bean there is, and usually just go with what is cheapest. Right now, that is pinto at my Walmart. You can adjust the seasonings to the beans you use. For example, chili powder for kidney beans, cumin, oregano and chili powder for pinto, basil and oregano for cannellini or white beans.  newlinechar  newlinechar My crockpot is a 6 quart and I can easily double the recipe to have leftovers for lunch. A double batch would be around $3.50, depending on your choice of beans.  newlinechar  newlinechar Another thing you could do is take two of the chicken quarters and cook them in water to make a broth. When done, remove the chicken and bring the broth to a boil. Once boiling, add a bag of noodles and cook until done. While the noodles are cooking, pick the chicken off the bone. When the noodles are done, add the chicken back to the pot and you have easy peasy chicken and noodles.

I think that is why he is trying to imply that mario is more appropriately popular, for lack of a better phrase. Mario made big changes for it's time, and was pretty important for when it came out on a technical level (or thats my understanding). It was something that for the most part had never been done before and exceled at it.  newlinechar  newlinechar Angry Birds, on the other hand, isn't original or innovative. The whole basis for the game already existed; the only difference between this and games like Crush the Castle are one has birds and pigs, and one has catapults and people.  newlinechar  newlinechar Both Mario and Angry Birds/Crush the Castle are fun. That's not really what he's getting at, from what I've percieved. Angry Birds appears to be popular because it's the 'in' game.  newlinechar  newlinechar If you gave the average person Angry Birds and Crush the Castle, which one do you think they would pick, assuming both were just as convenient to acquire and play?

I certainly can't argue with that, but I think the fact that the survivors don't always do exactly the right thing is important to the story.  The show isn't a survival manual, it's a drama about what real people might do during the zombie apocalypse.  However, it's not unreasonable to think that Shane is either former military or had military training as a cop, so he should realize that the group needs better protection than tents.  But, Shane thinks the government is going to show up really soon to sort the mess out, so that could be clouding his judgement.
Many legal scholars disagree with this view, including two 4-star generals, the ACLU, Glenn Greenwald, and others.

What your looking for is a 'talent agreement.' They're usually for six months and up to two years.

Yea let's just skip going down the 'Booo, invaders suck.' path. I grow weary of that attitude. It's very easy to not be invaded. I'm Soul Level 121 and that's the level all of my invading has been done at which means that I'm not invading beginners. In fact 80% of the time I'm invading people who are clearly there for PvP as well. I don't cheese, I don't cheat, it's just me and my sword most of the time. I don't invade out of malice, I just love to play. This is a multiplayer game, both coop and versus and that is part of what makes it great. It's part of what makes the world feel alive. I'm in Human form almost constantly now and I get invaded all the time too. I lose some, I win some, my Humanity count rises and falls every time I play, and it's all fun. If and when you choose to become more involved in PvP you'll come to see it for what it is: Versus Mode. A massively fun   chunk of this brilliant game that is often overlooked. newlinechar  newlinechar * And another thing! Seriously though, saying that *nobody* likes invasions and that people want them removed from the game is patently false.

Hmm, I doubt it, it'll definitely change, and you're likely right about 'stations' disappearing, at least, in their current state. However, I think it's more likely that we'll be able to have data streamed around the house into various devices, and probably into a central entertainment area with a screen that could be described as a 'TV'. Also, the short-form programming that TV brings will probably stick around, though more likely, it will be streamed off the internet (or whatever the equivalent at that point will be).  newlinechar  newlinechar Let's be honest though, if we read this thread in 50 years time, we'll probably all be completely incorrect, and this will look completely archaic.

I caught a female one night (with Grasshopper bait in a jar laid sideways in front of her) and tried to take her home. Mom freaked, so I gave her to the neighbor.  newlinechar  newlinechar It wasn't until I watched them feed and become defensive when he changed their water bowls that I started to not like them so much. I realized their potential, and their creepy defense mechanisms and movements. Over the years, it spiraled into full-on arachnophobia. I don't mind the small spiders as much, but once they're beyond 2 in. in diameter I seize up and hyperventilate. It must have been initiated at just the right time in my psychological development, because it's very engrained. I don't think I could ever be cured of it. newlinechar  newlinechar I still like to gain knowledge on spiders, though, which is why I'm subscribed to r/spiders. It's a love/hate relationship I suppose.  newlinechar  newlinechar Fun side story: the German neighbor's first Tarantula appeared to be dead, so he took her to a nearby lake and dumped her on the sand. She immediately stood up and ran away. Fucking *faked her death*! Or, so it seems. Still a mystery. Another time, he came home from the lake with an old Coca-Cola tin can (cube-shaped, large enough to store about 12 cans of Coke) and he called me over. 'Jared, I have to show you something!' I lean over the container, and he proceeds to pull off the lid. Inside is a fucking coiled-up [Water Moccasin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agkistrodon_piscivorus)! That snake could've fucking killed me.  newlinechar  newlinechar Crazy ass Germans.

Residential moving can be a tricky equation, with many variables, which is why you need a highly experienced residential moving company.

That is annoying but if the teacher wants you to know that method, then there is a reason. In differential equations, one can solve problems by using separable equations, exact equations, substitutions, euler's method (not recommended), reduction of order, undetermined coefficients, variation of parameters, laplace transforms and some others I'm sure I'm forgetting. Some ways to solve are faster than others and some only work in certain situations. In my class we weren't told what method to use, so we had to know how to use them all which is a pain in the ass when the teacher writes the problems so only one method works. So if you are marked down for not using the correct method in a high school class or on some homework in college or in high school, there is a reason; you must know all the methods.
Here's the problem.  The net neutrality issue brings us full circle to government regulation of the internet.  The government, through the FCC is allowed to 'sell' spectrum, lease 'their' lines to competitors, and enrich the profits.  Everything that was wrong with the AT&amp;T/T-Mobile bill is wrong about net neutrality.  What we need is an actual free market.  So if someone was hoping to censor the internet with SOPA, it would not be effective.  If someone else looked to censor companies from being competitors to AT&amp;T and T-Mobile, it would be difficult. newlinechar  newlinechar The broadband/wireless market should be competitive with more players than what the US currently has.  So long as people look at regulation as the answer to the broadband market rather than less restrictions, net neutrality will continue to be the wrong answer to the market.

There's still no mention of a body. In my opinion, he's speaking in metaphor. The 'flesh' he buried is The Hound's armor. He never says that Sandor is dead - the only time he mentions his real name, he says that he's 'at rest'. When last we saw him with Arya, he was delirious with pain. Yet the Elder Brother is able to describe his life, his dreams and his character in great detail. I can't imagine that a man in the shape Sandor was in would be able to divulge all of that information to the Elder Brother if he were truly on the verge of death. Then there's the gravedigger that's 'bigger than Brienne' and 'a novice'. How many people in Westeros are bigger than Brienne? And of those few who could qualify, I don't believe that two of them (Sandor and one other) would turn up at the same monastery at around the same time. There's just too much in the chapter that doesn't add up if we're to believe Sandor is dead.

When they were originally conceived, it was to give you a more cinematic experience/moment that they couldn't have otherwise implemented into the game as an unscripted occurrence. You only have so many buttons on a controller and it's difficult to make them do everything. To use God of War as an example, you've got your light and heavy attacks, specials, block, dodge roll, etc. but there's no place for the 'fling yourself into the sky and land on this boss's face and stab him' attack considering it's a one time event that will only show up at that point in the game.  newlinechar  newlinechar Where else do you put it? What other solution is there other than a QTE? You could leave it out entirely and make the fight far less cinematic, or you can remove the interaction and make it a cutscene/scripted event with no player control. In both cases, it's lose/lose, whereas the QTE gives you a middle ground where you get both the cinematic experience of a cutscene, but the interaction of gameplay.  newlinechar  newlinechar It's also not a 'fake' sense of control when there are very real consequences in the game when you fail to tackle them properly. Also, where do we draw the line between QTE and player input? *Technically*, Heavy Rain is one long QTE, but it's handled wonderfully. And what about Batman: AA/AC? The combat in it is incredibly rhythmic and feels very QTE-ish when you get into brawls and all you do is press the right button at the right time. In terms of how they *control*, the input is no different than when you're flying through the air as Kratos; All that's changed is you don't have to wait around as long for a scripted animation to finish with a fancy camera angle. So if that's the case, is the camera the only thing that qualifies it as a QTE, or are we considering one of the best games of 2011 a giant QTE? newlinechar  newlinechar Now, I'm not trying to be a crusader for QTEs mind you. It's that, unlike you, I don't think all QTEs are bad, but that there are good QTEs and bad QTEs. A QTE where I have to, say, dodge pillars that fall on the ground when I, the player, could've easily done that myself (PoP'08)? Not good. A QTE that lacks dynamic variables and only gives you a win/lose option for completing it correctly (ala RE4/5)? Also bad. QTEs that add an interactive and cinematic layer to the gameplay that could not be achieved without QTEs (GoW)? Good. QTEs with dynamic variables that give you multiple choices, options, and routes for completion (Heavy Rain)? Also good! newlinechar  newlinechar Like most things in life, there is no black and white answer. I think people are so quick to chalk up QTEs as a bad thing when they don't even realize what it's really adding to the game (for better or worse).

Oh man, I know it's not my AMA but I just thought of an old story from when I worked retail. This didn't happen in my store, but I knew a few people from the H&amp;M at the mall, and one of them told me about the time that a girl was in there with her dog (I don't know if it's just LA or everywhere, but people at that particular mall were really compelled to bring their dogs with them everywhere) and the dog peed on the floor. As if that wasn't bad enough, the owner picked up a garment (a piece of merchandise!) off a shelf, wiped up the dog piss with it, and put it back.

I'm kind of interested in your personal situation with your ex and now your fiance, and maybe how you think sex/serious relationships interact with academia. Your adventurous sex life might also be informative. newlinechar  newlinechar I'm actually just finishing up my own dissertation (only the standard 5 years for me!). When I came to graduate school I was engaged, after about two years of marriage she left me and I discovered that she'd been having an affair on me for most of a year; I actually discovered this by finding their box of sex toys while I was still moving stuff out of the apartment. She explicitly stated that 'bad sex' was a reason for what she did, though she was never communicative about it with me in the years we were together. A couple years later and despite a short interim relationship, I feel I still haven't recovered. Now I'm getting ready to head out into the world alone again, not knowing where I'll be in even a few months (unknown postdoc). newlinechar  newlinechar Do you think graduate school had anything to do with your divorce?

At least, up until the 12th grade (which is the last year of pre-college education).  Public universities/colleges (the term is mostly interchangeable) are subsidized by the state, but those do cost money to attend, though far less than private universities. newlinechar  newlinechar The quality of schools vary.  Some public schools struggle with discipline issues, and the teachers spend as much time trying to keep students pacified as they do teaching (which is pretty bad) where others do a very good job because the students are more well-behaved (usually in more affluent neighborhoods).  The choice of school is typically determined by where you live (the schools are designated for a certain area) though there is room for some exceptions.  Parents therefore worry about which neighborhood they live in and whether it's near a 'good' school. newlinechar  newlinechar The idea is private schools are expensive and most black families can't afford such schools and so they go to public schools.  Private schools have a reputation of being a bit posh (though probably nowhere near what it is in the UK where class differences are very pronounced). newlinechar  newlinechar The public schools are paid indirectly by state taxes.

&gt; In summary, there are three common uses of the term 'ape': non-biologists may not distinguish between 'monkeys' and 'apes', or may use 'ape' for any tailless monkey or nonhuman hominoid, whereas biologists traditionally used the term 'ape' for all non-human hominoids [...]. In recent years biologists have generally preferred to use only monophyletic groups in classifications, that is only groups which include all the descendants of a common ancestor. The superfamily Hominoidea is one such group (or 'clade'). Some then use the term 'ape' to mean all the members of the superfamily Hominoidea. For example, in a 2005 book, Benton wrote 'The apes, Hominoidea, today include the gibbons and orang-utan ... the gorilla and chimpanzee ... and humans'. The group traditionally called 'apes' by biologists is then called the 'nonhuman apes'.' newlinechar  newlinechar I think most people mean that.  Paraphyletic groups are an anachronism that comes from a time before we had genetics.  Thinking cladistically is much simpler and thus is preferable.  Got it my fellow lobed finned fish?

I posted this elsewhere but I'm posting this again because it needs to be read: newlinechar  newlinechar You are misinterpreting what the signing statement does. This is actually quite badass on his part. Congress' job is to write the laws, and it is the executive branch's job to enforce them. The signing statement is Obama saying he will *not* enforce the law as Congress intended it. If you read the whole statement, Obama goes over each problematic section and explains why it either is not a change from the status quo or why he can (and will) interpret it in such a way as to make the provision meaningless, or why the provision is unconstitutional and therefore can be ignored. Read the whole statement. Here are some highlights: newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;my Administration will not authorize the indefinite military detention without trial of American citizens. Indeed, I believe that doing so would break with our most important traditions and values as a Nation. My Administration will interpret section 1021 in a manner that ensures that any detention it authorizes complies with the Constitution, the laws of war, and all other applicable law. newlinechar  newlinechar ... newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;While section 1022 is unnecessary and has the potential to create uncertainty, I have signed the bill because I believe that this section can be interpreted and applied in a manner that avoids undue harm to our current operations. newlinechar  newlinechar ... newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;I have signed this bill on the understanding that section 1022 provides the executive branch with broad authority to determine how best to implement it, and with the full and unencumbered ability to waive any military custody requirement...under no circumstances will my Administration accept or adhere to a rigid across-the-board requirement for military detention. newlinechar  newlinechar ... newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Section 1028 [...] would, under certain circumstances, violate constitutional separation of powers principles. [...]In the event that the statutory restrictions in sections 1027 and 1028 operate in a manner that violates constitutional separation of powers principles, my Administration will interpret them to avoid the constitutional conflict. newlinechar ... newlinechar &gt; should any application of these provisions conflict with my constitutional authorities, I will treat the provisions as non-binding. newlinechar  newlinechar **TLDR: The purpose of the signing statement is to provide a legal case for Obama to simply ignore the problematic parts of the legislation. He signed the act but this is him promising not to enforce large parts of it. Obama is not betraying us.** newlinechar  newlinechar What Obama is doing here is very similar to how Bush used signing statements as almost a line item veto: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signing_statement#Controversy_over_George_W._Bush.27s_use_of_signing_statements newlinechar there is lots of legal scholarship on that if you want to learn more.

That sounds about right. It kind of goes along with the increasing feeling that everybody else can go fuck themselves. When I was younger I always tried to push to do things quickly, but after years of experience I know which kinds of things I can and can't do quickly, and I don't mind slowing down. That's a big part of it I think, that you care less and less about external pressure, if it means it's going to make you do things badly.

Well, I am a very libertarian minded person (Ron Paul 2012), and I can not find any place in the guiding principles of my religion where it says I should impose them on others. In fact free will is a crucial pillar of my beliefs.  newlinechar  newlinechar That being said, society imposes certain beliefs on individuals as a matter of course. We as a society impose our belief that you are not entitled to personally seek retribution for crime carried out against you for instance. Or our belief that you shouldn't drive drunk etc...  newlinechar  newlinechar I realize what you are trying to say, but you should realize that words are important, and when you make provocative statements like that, you are creating an image of yourself in the perceptions of others. What it does for most people is either inspire bandwagon jumping on (for those who agree with you) or violent repulsion (for those who disagree). What it does for a few of us is make us try to figure out what you are actually saying, and when you speak so sloppily, we generally come to the conclusion that you have no idea.  newlinechar  newlinechar You do seem mad.

This is the thing. I am so loyal, but lately I have been thinking about cheating, its not like me. I actually told him this, and he then gets angry that I would even suggest doing that - He doesnt get that he has some responsibility in being married to me in meeting my sexual needs too. I have tried to talk to him about 'other sexual options' (open relationship if he doesnt want sex) but he wont have it. I dont actually want that, i just want him to want me, and have mutual pleasure and sexual respect.  newlinechar  newlinechar Thanks for your advice, I think you might be right.

It's a good idea if you are that nation under threat. I'm all for disarmament, but there are some reasons why that's a difficult sale. There is also a couple of things you should consider, the US invasion and occupation of Iraq was a WMD - it killed tens of thousands. In addition there is an argument that nuclear arms have led to an age of stability, with proxy wars replacing war between great powers.
I think that's a load of bullshit, I don't even feel like arguing about it.
To put *something* in space? Yea. To launch a relevant communications satellite? Questionably, but most likely not (If they aren't aided by some super rich dude, or corporation). I'm not really well versed in the costs of building one, but I think spaceX can launch a decent amount of stuff to LEO for 10 million. 
I'm in the same boat as you, but there is one more thing to consider.  Bynum does not seem to be able to provide the minutes that Dwight does.  Bynum is fully healthy right now and was able to play in the preseason.  So then why did he state that he was tired when he only played 31 minutes?  He was suspended for less than a week, he shoudn't have gotten out of shape in that amount of time.   newlinechar  newlinechar When we had Pau to slide down and Odom to fill in off the bench, it wasn't as much of an issue.  But if Bynum is supposed to play a major role, I think he should be playing at least 36 minutes a game, I'm not sure he can do it.  Dwight can give 40 plus a night.  That said, I think your assessment of their abilities is spot on.
And he was a damn good shot, too (the two black ribbons on the bottom with the 'E' denote an Expert shot in both the Rifle and Pistol, if I'm reading them correctly).

Anyway, am I the only person who doesn't find these games hard? Sure, I die.. but I don't see it as failing, each death is fair and it's more of a learning experience, which is why it gives you the chance to go back to your blood stain. I love that feature, you can tell you're making progress as each time your blood stain is a little further out, if you die twice without getting to your blood stain then it sucks though. The thing about dark souls is that there's no real game over, when you die you don't fail you simply try again. I hardly ever find the game frustrating.

My calculus exams back in University usually only required you to solve 4 problems (sometimes split into subcategories, such as problem 1.a, 1.b etc.). Each exam was 3 hour long and you couldn't use any calculators or other similar tools to help out. newlinechar  newlinechar This meant each problem usually took a few pages of handwritten calculations to solve. newlinechar  newlinechar When you are doing multiple pages of calculations, for just a single problem, a single irrelevant error can lead to a completely wrong final solution. Yet those multiple pages of calculations can still easily show the professor that you actually perfectly understood the method he was testing you on. In those cases, the teacher can be 'lenient' and give you a full or near-full grade for your answer. This is because the final solution isn't actually what he is testing you for. He is testing to see if you understand and know how to apply a certain method (or a set of methods). newlinechar  newlinechar What is considered a relevant or an irrelevant error obviously varies.

He will also implement a Free Market system that has zero corporate regulations.  He will allow states to dictate their drug, alcohol, and tobacco laws.  He will expand States Rights which will very likely ban any Choice for Women in many southern states.  Ron Paul wants to repeal the Civil Rights Act and Voting Rights Act despite the fact incidents of discrimination and voter disenfranchisement are still happening.  He also wants to shut down the Department of Education and the Department of Health.  Many valid concerns about these closures abound.  The Department of Health prevents epidemics through vaccination programs for children and elderly.  Letting states have total control over their respective public school systems is of extreme concern considering how state government officials are already attempting to re-write history textbooks and remove Evolution from the curriculum.

[This NYT article](http://loyalopposition.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/12/16/beyond-eeny-meeny-miny-moe-sorting-out-the-g-o-p-field/?hp) helped me a lot: newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar **Michele Bachmann** is the obvious choice for a true Tea Party believer, who wants a candidate to carry the banner of far right contempt for and alienation from Washington. Other candidates try on the Tea Party tri-corn, but it doesn’t fit. Ms. Bachmann is the real deal – and for that reason, I think she has no chance of winning. newlinechar  newlinechar **Rick Santorum** is the candidate for a Republican who places a high premium on strongly conservative social positions sincerely held. Mr. Santorum doesn’t just talk about these issues, he’s voted on them repeatedly. He is inflexibly opposed to a woman’s right to make decisions about her reproductive life. He is clearly religious but doesn’t exploit it like like Gov. Rick Perry, who wears his Christianity on his sleeve and across his shirts, like a Nike swoosh. And if you really care about abortion, as in banning it, Mr. Santorum is your guy. newlinechar  newlinechar **Rick Perry** is an alternative for voters who are driven by their Christian faith, and don’t mind that he’s going to embarrass them by using their common religion in a comic-opera way. People who miss George W. Bush and want to make that mistake all over again could do a lot worse than Mr. Perry. That also goes for death penalty advocates. Mr. Perry is not reliably rightwing on immigration, but I can’t imagine that he would actually pursue his beliefs on the subject if he got into office. Kind of like Mr. Bush. newlinechar  newlinechar **Jon Huntsman** is the obvious choice for more moderate Republicans who like a candidate who can articulate his positions, has experience in international affairs (remember when Republicans actually cared about that?), has governing experience (as governor of Utah) and knows his way around the executive branch. You just have to get over the fact that he seems certain to lose, big. newlinechar  newlinechar **Ron Paul** is a no-brainer if you want the candidate who has the most clearly held views and is not afraid to break with orthodoxy (like admitting he’s to the left of President Obama on Iran). You have to be a libertarian, which to me is a really eccentric idea for a governing philosophy. I get what happens on Day 1: You bring the federal government down to Somali proportions. What do you do on Day 2? Step over the homeless and the hungry on your way to a Cato Institute meeting? newlinechar  newlinechar **Newt Gingrich** is the front runner if you believe the polls. Personally, I can’t believe even the fringe Republicans who dominate the Iowa caucuses would nominate him. But if you want a bomb-throwing neo-conservative who hates the very idea of a government that helps those who need help, then Mr. Gingrich is the right choice. He is anti-abortion, anti-gay, anti-gun control, anti-judge, anti-almost anything you can name. The catch is that he may well be unelectable beyond the narrow confines of the Republican primary system. His positions, starting with his utter contempt for an independent judiciary, are far too radical. (By the way, his take on Jefferson and the courts last night was not quite historically accurate.) It’s hard to imagine a broad range of Americans tolerating his buffoonish posing as a historian statesman, when really he’s a history influence peddler, or his tendency to compare himself to Reagan, Jefferson, Jackson, Lincoln and Theodore Roosevelt. But, if you’re a true science-fiction fanatic who wouldn’t mind a government shutdown or a few constitutional crises, vote for Mr. Gingrich. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar **Mitt Romney**. It’s hard to characterize the kind of Republican voter who should choose Mr. Romney, because we have no clue what he actually believes. If you’re opposed to health care reform, and are troubled by the fact that he was a pioneer in that area, you can be comforted by the fact that whatever he believes, he will probably govern from the quasi-conservative positions he’s been taking lately. He seems like the most electable of the group right now, mostly because he’s the least terrifying to people who are not committed right-wingers. He could, theoretically, pose the greatest threat to Mr. Obama.

Yeah, if you're not willing to change your position, then there's not much point in discussing it. If you want to get to a place where you might want to become more open, I'd suggest spending more time on skeptical media than specifically atheist media. Carl Sagan's 'Demon Haunted World' is quite popular for that purpose. I'd suggest that you try to make your religion less a way to define yourself and more a testable hypothesis about the nature of reality which you happen to believe at the moment.

I agree.  From a personal perspective, the rational response is to take steps to minimize harm to yourself and others around you.  Of course, this can at times conflict with the desire to bring long-term massive societal change which maximizes freedom and safety for groups which are discriminated against.  I imagine that most of the posters who disagree with you probably are thinking more about the second goal than the first.   newlinechar  newlinechar I've never directly experienced the issues many male redditors complain about.  (Of course, that may be because almost everyone around me has always been super-nice and above-average).  Nonetheless, reading about them absolutely terrifies me because I don't see any way to protect myself.   newlinechar  newlinechar Psychologically, the only way to avoid having that impact me was to say, my chances of being falsely accused are very low given my behavior, so I'll just have to put it in the category of things like being killed a falling space station toilet seat that are too unlikely to worry about.

**LOUD NOISES**
Nah, dude. When a man consents to have sex with a woman, he's consenting to have sex. That's it.  newlinechar  newlinechar The only responsibility that the man and woman share is to agree to use birth control, or not. After that, the ball is in the woman's court for the rest of the game.  newlinechar  newlinechar And it's not nearly the horrific, oppressive burden it may seem to be. In terms of consensual sex, it's the woman's body that can become pregnant, either accidentally or on purpose, and thus it is her responsibility to protect her own body. She has a wide variety of non-permanent birth control options to protect herself, or barring that, can instruct her partner to condom up. newlinechar  newlinechar Also, while men may wear condoms which are quite visible to their partners, most forms of birth control that women use require her to confirm to the man that she is protected. There's no way for him to know aside from taking her word. This opens up the potential for mistakes in judgement or even deceit on the woman's part to result in a much higher risk of pregnancy that the man did not and *would not* consent to if he were properly informed.  newlinechar  newlinechar As such, if the agreement is to prevent pregnancy, the final responsibility must rest with the woman to ensure she is protected, or to ensure that her partner is wearing condoms. newlinechar  newlinechar If accidental pregnancy should then occur, the woman has many options. She may abort, adopt out, or carry and raise the fetus. As it stands today, the man has -zero- options, and often his personal and financial futures are tied to a decision he has *no part in making*. If she decides to keep a child whose conception he did not consent to, he's stuck. No choices, no rights. Any given woman will always be guaranteed an option to opt out of parental responsibilities. As such, the same option must be guaranteed to men.  newlinechar  newlinechar No man may force a woman to abort or carry a fetus to term, it is her body and her decision.  newlinechar No woman *should be able to* force a man to bear personal or financial responsibility for a child he did not want. As it stands, however, once she's pregnant, his life and livelihood is essentially in her hands, and he has no alternatives. newlinechar  newlinechar Men want equality. Nothing more, nothing less.

I think many, many, MANY women have been through something like this. I don't know what you're arguing style is like, but it's one of the most important parts of a relationship. When you confront eachother don't yell. That means everyone is on the defensive and not willing to listen. If he starts yelling be the bigger person, and keep talking in a normal voice. Telling someone to calm down usually just makes them more angry. Focus on this issue and don't bring up past events. Getting off topic is no way to resolve the issue at hand. Make sure both of you understands what the other is saying. When one of you makes a point ask him if it makes sense to him, and if not why. Not having you're feelings validated is frustrating, but you gatta keep at it. Make sure it's resolved before you stop. You can take a small break if you want, but keep it as a break. Personally, I don't think it's worth it. Every time I've been in this situation it has never worked out. I'm sorry if you already know all this, but in my experience most people don't. Sorry this is so long.

Most of the complaining about Go and Dart arises from the fact that they claim to solve Programming Languages (PL) problems, and yet ignore every single advance that academic and industrial PL research and development has made in.... in *ever*. newlinechar  newlinechar If you want the field to improve its professional standards, Mr Pike, perhaps you could do your part by listening to the trained experts and practitioners on relevant matters, or at least not *flagrantly insult* us?
I agree. They didn't have to do any of this. You had a shot at getting something good, but if you didn't what did you lose.

I always wear my jacket when I ride. I have had it for 5 years and I NEVER ride without it. I live in Texas where it gets extremely hot in the summer time but I still wear it. Talking to other riders I have learned that you aren't going to find anything that you wont sweat in. You can find some jackets that are simply mesh and have no or minimal armor but I recommend something like [this](http://www.olympiamotosports.com/airglide/airglide.htm). That is the exact one I have and it only gets hot when you aren't moving because it is aerated. I have also been in a couple spills wearing that jacket and haven't had a scratch on me. It really is worth the money. I hope this helps.

What you are trying to recall is that most printers have no way to accurately determine how much ink is left in a cartridge. There is no sensor, so they attempt to guess how much is left by how often that cartridge has been used. Most of them are conservative, the idea being that you replace the cartridge *before* you get half-way through an 8x10 photo and run out. Like all estimates, its based on assumptions, meaning that there are almost certainly pathological cases were its simply wrong. So there is a chance you'll print a lot of stuff that matches those odd cases and it'll be way off in its guess. newlinechar  newlinechar All of the printers that I've personally owned that did this had methods to either force them to continue printing, no matter how much ink they 'thought' was left (Lexmark), or the cartridge could be 'reset' in some way (Epson).

Yes and that's the point...it does not matter why the author described the car as being blue. Authors often do that simply for texture and intend no further meaning. But the reason we ask the question is, we want the student to consider what the blueness of the car could *possibly* mean, and we want them to discuss it analytically. One student may draw a comparison with the freshness of spring. Another the color of the character's father's shirt. Whatever. But if they can convince ME that their meaning of blue is probable, and enhances their net profit from having read the text...they have done the work and honed a valuable skill.

I don't necessarily disagree that getting a nuke is a good idea for Iran (though obviously if the US, Saudi Arabia, UAE, or any other country decides to invade it will be proven to have been folly), it's just a *terrible*, *heinously risky* thing for the rest of the world.  As for your arguments: newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;the US invasion and occupation of Iraq was a WMD - it killed tens of thousands. newlinechar  newlinechar Hundreds of thousands, actually.  But the deadliness of the US military does not invalidate the deadliness of nuclear weapons.  Furthermore, US military action is extremely unlikely to ever actually destroy all civilization as we know it.  Nuclear weapons being used by Iran, or any of the terrorist organizations it supports, could easily do so.   newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;In addition there is an argument that nuclear arms have led to an age of stability, with proxy wars replacing war between great powers. newlinechar  newlinechar A belief negated by the Cuban Missile Crisis.  If two of the most powerful nations on Earth - both literally with the brightest minds we could muster consulting them - nearly triggered nuclear holocaust, I shudder to think what any nation without those resources would do.  Most of the Iranian government would probably prefer to avoid using nuclear weapons offensively.  But what of the individuals who do?  And which of those individuals may have the ability to give those weapons to others?  And how many of them have ties to anti-Saudi or anti-Israeli groups? newlinechar  newlinechar Even if we accept that it was nuclear weapons that created the stability, I contend that this stability is still quite tenuous.  MAD only works if the balance of power is relatively equal, and all sides fear destruction.  We have already established that Hezbollah members, at least, do not fear death whatsoever.  What, then, would happen if they 'accidentally' come to possess nuclear bombs?  And if they did, how would they use them?  Even if they didn't, the mere *threat* of using them would irrevocably destroy relations between the nations of the mid-east.

there was an AMA with a developer about a month ago where someone brought up color blindness. here's his response: newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;We actually have a guy on our team who is color blind and consulted with him on some things we can do to provide additional information for color blind folks.

We also have height information on the notes (the stems underneath the notes) to help provide context of which string it belongs to. We also tried not to put colors that are typically hard to tell apart for color blind people on adjacent strings.

From the people that I talk to, 'Romani' is used to refer to the ethnicity, and 'Gypsies' is used exclusively for nomadic hustlers like the stereotypical Gypsy and Irish travellers. newlinechar  newlinechar Because of this, I would consider it politically incorrect to refer to Romani ethnicity as 'Gypsy', but if you were hustled by a vagrant I wouldn't take issue with you calling that person a Gypsy. newlinechar  newlinechar I think it would be beneficial for society to distance the word 'Gypsy' from the Romani people, rather than considering them to be synonyms.

By that logic, if someone feels obligated to help their friend move, then said friend is guilty of slavery. newlinechar  newlinechar IMO, it depends on why they feel obligated.  If they feel obligated because they think some unlawful harm (violence, economic harm) will befall them if they don't give in, then that could be coercive.  If they feel obligated simply because they think they owe their partner or don't want to make their partner unhappy (not because of fear), then I say they've made a free choice. newlinechar  newlinechar You're not entitled to your partner's happiness or affection, so if your SO pouts after you refuse sex with him/her, I don't think that's enough to compel you to do something you don't want to do.

A Radeon 4850 gets just under 40fps at 1080p on low settings. I guess pretty well means 'just about', especially at that settings, at it being a 4830 instead of 4850. Lets also not forget 40fps is average so as much as you will get 60fps when hugging a rock you will also get &lt;20fps during intense battles (when you really need/want the high fps). newlinechar  newlinechar Sure the 4830 is totally fine for Skyrim but BF3 it might be time considering upgrading - at least if you play BF3 as your main game. newlinechar  newlinechar http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/battlefield-3-graphics-performance,3063-9.html

Get to know.     newlinechar Brostep is just garish noise for children, Dubstep was deep, dark and thoughtful music. Hence the reason a chiptune artist from japan got a release on one of the founding labels of dubstep (note, not brostep) back in '07.     newlinechar Just to blow your mind a little bit more, Zomby released lots of great stuff back around the same time. Most notably this: [Aquafresh](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_PjKUp7VSQ)     newlinechar Which sampled this: [Robotron](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZsIyJehtE8)     newlinechar Anyone who samples Robotron gets a chiptune tick from me.     newlinechar So rather then using dubstep as a blanket term, stick to using brostep.

NPH is gay.  Maybe you're thinking the character Barney? 
I generally don't refer to it as porn that 'guys like.'  But the poster brought in the issue of gender-specificity. newlinechar  newlinechar I was trying to emphasize the fact that I can find my own damn porn, and I stay away from any porn that markets itself as female-friendly.  I am just not interested.   newlinechar  newlinechar For you to jump on me for being sexist is pretty lame.  As you just said, when people say 'female-specific' they DO mean softer and more romantic.   newlinechar  newlinechar And, for the record, I know there are a shit-ton of women who like the rougher stuff.  But THEY (we) are not the women being catered to with 'female-friendly' porn. newlinechar  newlinechar It's like video games.  There are PLENTY of girl gamers who like traditional, mainstream video games.  But since a lot of girls don't like traditional video games, the developers have created a niche market, geared to appeal to females.  A lot of girl gamers probably stay away from those games, because they would rather play your normal, violent/graphic/creepy/whatever games.  That isn't sexism on the part of the girl gamers ... it is an understanding that that niche is not for them.

I'm saying that Russians/Ukranians have always had better level teams than everyone else, except for the Chinese and select SEA teams. And if you're playing at a decent level and run into someone who's Russian, odds are he's really, really good.

It's because, frankly, it's likely they've just played a lot more dota than a random NA player. newlinechar  newlinechar It's also easy to hate Russian players becuase of cognitive bias, and they stand out more than NA players.

'For the sake of this answer I am going to define “conquest” as a game type that utilizes control points to accrue score. Using this definition, then we are not considering adding any other game types before launch. We want each map we release to be completely unique. We feel that we can get a ton of variety out of our maps by changing the secondary objectives and mechanics. For example, we won’t be launching with another map with trebuchets and destroyable terrain; those things are reserved for the Battle of Kyhlo map. The other maps we are testing all have some very involved mechanics and unique playstyles in them and we wanted a core game mechanic that was easily learned by players and stayed consistent across the maps we release at launch. This will ultimately help players learn each map and the game since they don’t have to relearn an entirely new scoring mechanic for every map they play on. newlinechar Once the game matures a bit, it is likely that we’ll experiment with both new maps and some new game types if we find a demand for them from our players.' newlinechar  newlinechar I guess world pvp is different but I think you are still capturing locations just in a larger scale.

I think it's implied that she was a bitch *about not eating meat*. A vegan girlfriend is different than a bitch of a vegan girlfriend. Each person's dietary supplement is their own choice, and I'm perfectly fine with vegans/etc. but once you make your argument for it, leave it up to each person to decide for themselves.  newlinechar  newlinechar I've known several people who *require* their significant others to adhere to their diet as a clause of their relationship, which is just stupid.
I think the way that vegans look at is that 'veganism' isn't just not eating animal products, it's not eating animal products *for ethical reasons*. So, as I understand it, if you only eat plant-based products but don't care about ethics, you're not technically vegan. You actually need to be in support of animal rights before you can call yourself a vegan. newlinechar  newlinechar I don't particularly understand it, but that's the way it's been told to me.

Those are all good points. For Niche markets, indeed there are other options - I just don't have time to chase them all down so it is not a model that is cost efficient for me (time is money). I work with people, models, objects and food. Food does really well on Microstock, shockingly well. I have been fortunate.  newlinechar  newlinechar News/Editorial images are rough, and that whole industry has changed as well. The only one I had a TON of success with was the Shutterstock on the Red Carpet Program. They can get you access/passes you wouldn't normally otherwise get without the hassle and expense of being a membership of a professional freelance association. You only have to maintain the images at their library exclusively for 2 years in exchange for the service (fair, imo), and they turn around the photos (from upload to online) in less than 24 hours. newlinechar  newlinechar Microstock companies are shifting too. I think Getty owns iStock, and Corbis owns Jupiter Images (or something like that) and there has been dawning realization that they have in a sense, cannibalized their own larger sales and have created the market that no one likes (I don't like it either). Many microstocks have shifted their business model for higher end collections (certainly not like the past however) and are scrambling, trying to recoup losses in that way.  Someone mentioned in another comment that iStock is dying. It does seem that way, but probably to benefit shareholders and the former business model.  newlinechar  newlinechar I was thinking about this too after leaving my last comment - with the advent of the digital age and the way things are published now, while the prices have gone down significantly, the amount of people using these images (bloggers, online magazines, etc) has increased dramatically. I still believe that at the end of the day it will all balance out for the seasoned professionals who put out consistent good work.  newlinechar  newlinechar My apologies if I sound defensive, but I've gone through all of these 'WTF, seriously' moments myself.

Why? You have the ability to create your own sub. The way they handle it allows mods (like myself) to create places in a specific vision.

&gt;  it seems that it's portrayed that way with everything I read. newlinechar  newlinechar I'm going to make a small assumption and say that you haven't been reading scientific literature, nor even literature by notable scientists dumbing it down for the layman.   newlinechar  newlinechar The Big Bang is a 'begining' but only in the sense that we don't have data beyond that point.  It is quite common for Christians to understand science while being stuck in their box.  I come across it a lot.  Here, the assumption is 'In the beginning was the word...' and that is the beginning of time.  In science, Big Bang is just the beginning of what we can talk about.  Why don't you breeze of some science articles with this  new understanding.  The words may mean different things to you now. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Can't I just ask who created him? newlinechar  newlinechar Yes, yes!  That's exactly cuzincuz's and my point.  Remember this conversation is in regards to your assertion that 'there can't be a beginning of time when you ask [what if something created God].' newlinechar  newlinechar For your original position, there can't be more than 1 God who created the world.  However, I hold there can be almost infinitely many Gods creating each other in sequence until we get to the God who we believe created the world, and the world would not be changed a bit.  Where is the change?  Where is the malfunction that prevents this from happening? (you seemed to have missed this important question from my previous post) newlinechar  newlinechar If you are trying to argue a First Mover argument, it is unclear because your thinking is a bit confused and hard to follow.  The answer to what my guess you are arguing is this syllogism: newlinechar  newlinechar (1) You hold that 'the world doesn't exist' and 'there is not a beginning of time' when one asks 'what if something created God?'  God is an uncreated thing exists all on its own without any intervention from anything else.  newlinechar  newlinechar (2) Therefore, you admit that things can exist uncreated by other things newlinechar  newlinechar (3a) You stop at only 1 uncreated thing.  Why?  What reason have you to believe that only 1 uncreated thing ever spontaneously came into existence.  If it happened once, why not many times?  Why not constantly? newlinechar  newlinechar (3b) I beleive cuzincuz was getting at the point that the universe doesn't need to be created by a god.  It can simply be one of those spontaneously uncreated things.  On what grounds do you say that the universe must be created?  (If you say harmony of the universe, I will say you are quite unread in astronomy.  There is great violence and conflict amongst the stars, being eaten whole, planets smashing into suns, large asteroids smashing into planets, decimating them, knocking them off axis, entire solar systems colliding with each other, etc) newlinechar  newlinechar You still have not been clear on why you think the world would not exist and also how time would not have a beginning.  I am very confused on this subject (I can't make a flattering argument for you).  I think this is because you are confused on the subject yourself.

Yes, I think you've basically got a handle on it now.  My only addition would be that it's very easy to go from 'Here are the things you should do to avoid rape' to 'Here are the things you didn't do that made you get raped'.  Even if you personally would never do this (and I trust that you wouldn't!), it's dangerous to set up a precedent where the onus of not getting raped is always on the woman and not the rapist.  Rape culture lends us to thinking about what women can do to not get raped rather than focusing on why people rape in the first place and doing something to stop it at the source.  That's why the 'My Strength is Not for Hurting' and 'Men Can Stop Rape' campaigns are getting such positive reinforcement in feminist circles.  Because it feels like *finally* someone is saying that the only person responsible for stopping rape is the rapist.   newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;If I understand this correctly, it would be acceptable for me to say to someone (who has not been a victim of rape) 'In order to help keep you safe, you should always tell someone where you are going, and, if you can, bring friends with you.' This would help prevent the rarer 'stranger rape' but would not help prevent the more common 'rape by someone you know.' It would also be sound and courteous advice to say 'Be careful who pours your drinks, to avoid roofies.'  newlinechar  newlinechar My only hesitation with this is that I think it can come off kind of pretentious depending on who you're saying it to and what context.  Many women know this stuff already.  It's been drilled into our heads by Lifetime movies, after-school specials, ad campaigns, etc.  So I would be careful about when you want to pull out this advice and consider if it's wanted.  Honestly, if I was going out to a club and my male friend said, 'Make sure you watch your drink and don't get roofied!', I'd be a little annoyed.  Because I know that; I'm told that all the time.   newlinechar  newlinechar If you wanted to try and use these tips to set up some sort of safety guideline for your school to hand out to girls who might be going to frat keggers, then that's a different story.  But again, it gets problematic when we expect the girl to 'not get raped' as opposed to expecting people to 'just not rape' them.

YAY for senior cats!   newlinechar It makes you all warm and fuzzy to watch them gain confidence in their new home, and you...I loved this experience with my senior kitty - sadly she was more senior than originally thought and was only with us for 4 years. newlinechar  newlinechar It's so nice to find others who are concerned about the real facts of the quality of food for their animal friends.  Sounds like those two kitties found *exactly* the person they needed to live out their lives happily :3 newlinechar  newlinechar A little OT, however... newlinechar &gt;The 2 cats are a bit nervous. The vet recommended I feed them a food specially designed for anxiety/nervous cats.  newlinechar  newlinechar I have had excellent personal experience with 3 different cats using [Rescue Remedy as well as specific other flower remedies](http://www.bachflower.com/Pets.htm), and I would very strongly recommend it.   newlinechar  newlinechar (I swear it saved one of my cats' lives - he was *seriously* upset due to circumstances - already somewhat anxious by nature (I referred to him as autistic) and had stopped eating or drinking anything at all for over 2 days - this from a cat who's appetite was like a dog - eat ALL the things!  Rescue remedy had him eating within 2 hours of applying it to his fur, and then I used Mimulus to help him get over his anxiety.  newlinechar  newlinechar I know it reads like it's mumbo jumbo, but it's inexpensive, doesn't counteract with any medication, and doesn't need to be taken internally...and it works.   newlinechar  newlinechar btw: I don't work for the company or sell the product or anything like that - just someone who's found it works when nothing else does.

I have that.  It's not my impression that circumcision is any more necessary here than in any of those other cases it's advocates mention.  I did a bit of research, and the internet's overwhelming consensus is that if you work on stretching it every day (twice a day is the general recommendation) the problem can be eliminated in about three to six weeks.  I've spent the last year not trying to get laid because my doctor told me I'd have to get circumcised, and then it occurred to me to do my research, and after about two weeks I seem to be making excellent progress. newlinechar  newlinechar Also, there seem to be multiple treatments considerably less drastic which deal with the problem if stretching doesn't work.  Most sites recommend trying stretching first though.  From the above wikipedia article: newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Common treatments include steroid creams, preputioplasty, manual stretching, and circumcision.[11] newlinechar  newlinechar Given the number of people who have asked about phimosis, or at least what seem to be it's symptoms on this subreddit, we should have some advice pegged on the sidebar.

You're right that you don't *have* to pay them, the same way you don't have to pay me if you want to take my laptop.  However, that doesn't give you the right to do either of those things, and we would have the right to attempt to stop you.  Any sort of rights require enforcement of some kind, even my right to life.  Just because I probably can't stop you from killing me doesn't make it acceptable for you to do so. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;I don't have the same opportunity, they all have more money than I do, and that affords them greater opportunity. newlinechar  newlinechar You're right, they do have a greater opportunity.  I'm trying to argue against the original point that it would be completely unacceptable to place art in the places where you'd normally find advertising.  I don't think the owners of the space have any particular bias towards advertising or against art, they just want to get paid.  If an artist were willing to pay more than an advertising agency, I'm sure they'd sell him the space.  As you pointed out, the advertisers tend to have more money, so they can afford to buy most of the space.  And it's not just that they have more money to begin with; the billboards presumably make them more money.  If artists can figure out a way to generate money from putting their art on billboards, I'm sure they'll start doing it.
And what about those of us who have been following it and don't think it's that big a deal.  Some mid-level bureaucrat should probably lose their job but I don't see it going any farther than that.  
The only thing that gives cats that 'wild streak' is letting them outdoors.

Except conservative prepublicans can be shown (by their political party's actions)  to believe in a specific set of implementations.     newlinechar  newlinechar I assure you that of the 1000s of christian denominations,   they all differ,  some at extreme odds.   I agree this is also true of conservatives,   however,  politically,  the candidates are limited and don't match analogously with the wide spread of various Christian denominations,  which are to each their own.   There is no 'Christian' descriptor to a single person that can be made,  as the groups are discrete,  again not the case with political party choices within a specific group.      newlinechar  newlinechar In this case it is the difference between   'those who believe in american democratic process and those who don't'    If I were to apply statements about the prior,  were I a member of the latter,  then it would be a problem,  because I'm speaking for a group of people who all belong separately to groups that think much differently from each other.

I would REALLY, REALLY like to know your answer, especially if you are in a hurry, let's say on your way to work? newlinechar  newlinechar Also, you don't understand by not putting in the order when you said you could have 'At this point, I should be putting in your entree order, but the people with the drinks have now been waiting 10 minutes total' you have just delayed our entrée orders, NOT the kitchen staff. newlinechar  newlinechar You see, most of the time, your server is at fault for most issues. They are ALWAYS at fault for wrong prices unless they are not the last person to give us our check. newlinechar  newlinechar I just want to know WHY do you think it's 'FAIR' or 'MORALLY RIGHT' to hand people things out of order off a tray? newlinechar  newlinechar WHY do you think it's fair to not put entrée orders into the computer in your scenario when you said you should have, but did not do it, WHY? If we ordered first, we ordered first.  newlinechar  newlinechar I hate you condoning cutting. Cutting is not nice, no matter WHERE you are, even in ER it probably sucks(I have never been fortunately). newlinechar  newlinechar NOBODY LOVES WAITING, NOBODY. The thing is, if you have table 1 that asks for their check, as you pass by table 2 asked for 2 refills, and as you pass by table 3 asked for another side of ranch for their side salad.  Table 1 should get their check first since they asked first, that's just the 'RIGHT' thing to do. It has NOTHING to do with priority. One thing is not more important than the other tasks. I don't get HOW you come up with PRIORITY? I think it's that you are TOO LAZY to make separate trips or take a tray jack with you so you hand out the soup first off the tray that was ordered last. newlinechar  newlinechar Table 2 should get their refills. I make a separate trip to get the ranch if I have to pour it or get it poured. If it's poured already, I would grab it along with the 2 refills, BUT I would hand the 2 refills FIRST.  newlinechar  newlinechar NO ONE tasks is more important than the other unless there was a mistake involved or a spill for example that could lead to someone slipping and falling. newlinechar  newlinechar Now change the scenario to table 3 let's say they didn't want ranch that they had a problem with their steak, well table 3 would go ahead of the other 2 tables, because they had a MISTAKE, which honestly it was their turn first to begin with, because they had a MISTAKE. newlinechar  newlinechar Now do you see what a PRIORITY really is? Soup or entrées aren't more important than each other unless there was a mistake or spill involved. The things that go first are the things that were ORDERED FIRST.  newlinechar  newlinechar I don't get why you think soup would have priority over entrées if they didn't contain mistakes? newlinechar  newlinechar

You are absolutely, one hundred percent full of shit if you're saying you wouldn't be just a little peeved if a heavily upgraded revision of the very expensive, flagship gadget you just bought got released a couple of months after it launched. newlinechar  newlinechar *None* of the current Galaxy Nexus owners (myself included) would have bought the phone as released if we'd known this was going to be the case. Based on past history, Nexus devices come out at most once a year. We bought them thinking this was going to be the best and only current-generation developer phone for at least another year, and were prepared to overlook its flaws for that reason. For them to release a 'fixed' model almost immediately afterward is just a big slap in the face. newlinechar  newlinechar The issue is that it's the *same product*. The Galaxy S III is probably going to come out at about the same time as any new revsion, and it is going to shit all over the GN in terms of specifications - I knew this when I bought my phone and was perfectly happy to make that compromise. I wanted a Nexus phone, even though it was very expensive for what it was, and reasonably (I thought) assumed it was my only choice for the next year. When they re-release the exact same phone, only better, the inference is that your phone is the inferior, broken model. Not a nice feeling.
Something I've been wondering lately is if the Dany who emerged from the pyre is the same Dany who went in.  newlinechar  newlinechar In a metaphoric sense, she killed the frightened girl she was in order to let the warrior queen emerge.

I am only a junior in High School, but I figured this was the place to post this, so here goes. (Sorry if it's a bit long-ish) I am still a bit well known for kicking ass, just from the two times I had to do it in my eighth grade year. The first time, I was in PE and we were having a free day, and I chose to jog the track. I was on the final lap of my second mile, when the stereotypical black chick with all fat white friends decided to WALK the opposite direction that I was, and with her friends, take up all eight lanes. (It was a red clay track.) I politely asked her from a short distance away to clear my lane, but instead, she and all of her cronies crowded into it, preventing me from continuing. She got in my face, telling me to move aside, and then tried to shove me back with her arms folded across her chest. So I got tired of it, crossed my arms, and twisted, throwing her off balance. She landed ass-first in the nasty damp red clay. As I continued around, I told my gym coach to keep an eye on her. I ended up meeting her again on the other end of the track, and she was VERY pissed. She started to get in my face again, but the Coach saw, and called her over. She got suspended because he heard her threaten to kick my teeth through my skull.

I'm not sure what you mean by 'hooded lids' - I do have a crease, however my crease does not hang over my lids nor is my crease particularly prominent. I have a very small lid space. One trick is make sure you are using a matte shadow in the crease. I very, very rarely use a shimmery shadow in the crease. In fact, in the sixth photo, I believe every single shadow I've used is matte. I use a MAC 217 brush and place the roundest end of the brush directly in my crease, and just use a sort of windshield wiper motion to deposit the color. I always use a very light amount of shadow on my brush and slowly build up the color. Also, make sure you are doing something with your brows. That can make a big difference in your ability to carry makeup on the eyes. I find that when you have perfectly groomed and filled in brows, very little looks 'too dramatic.'  newlinechar  newlinechar I hope I've answered your question, please let me know if there's anything else I can do to clarify.

I think you're right about the need for more productive criticism. However, I'd be a bit reluctant to say it is just a matter of budget. More so with female fashion than male even, low cost outfits can be had that look great. It is more a matter of understanding how different cuts of clothing work or don't work, and how layers can do wonders to making something that would otherwise be questionable look quite presentable. It's a matter of discouraging things like tight on tight with hulking boots; things that are almost always going to look terrible regardless of age or budget. newlinechar  newlinechar But you're right, I think there is a lot of room for applying advice to a broad range of in styles in fashionable ways. Just, as a community, it has to be understood that there is a difference between having 'unique' style and missing out on having a reasonable style completely.

Their reasons were '**I did** this' and '**I did** that' and 'I did it in your name! Ain't I holy?' No. The point of the gospel is that we can't save ourselves so Jesus has to step in. The moment we think we 'deserve' to enter heaven, we've lost sight of why Jesus even came to earth.

I'm in Canada, and this took place in Ontario where there are only gov't liquor stores that close pretty early.  newlinechar  newlinechar I was mostly kidding and certainly didn't make a regular habit of it but on a couple of occasions my friends and I would be in downtown Toronto, pre-drink at an apartment, go to the bar for a bit, then take some roadies   for the long subway ride up to campus to go to a party.

Even if you have a full squad of friends, your team can still lose miserably b/c the opposite team is actually playing the objective while your team is a bunch of CoD kids that only care about their KDR. I've been in ENTIRELY too many games with this happening and it pisses me off as well. If you want to do nothing but kill kill kill, go play TDM and stop crowding servers where people actually want to play the game mode properly. That along with the non-existent team balancing that PS3 servers have, getting on a good team is almost impossible. Playing against an entire team of level 10+ Colonels vs 30 norms and lower is just ridiculous.

&gt; why religion is inherently immoral, and atheism is inherently a more moral position newlinechar  newlinechar Nietzsche disagrees. newlinechar  newlinechar Furthermore, I'd like to mention your list is exhaustive, and isn't as 'immoral' as you seem to masquerade it as.  newlinechar  newlinechar The Bible is both descriptive and prescriptive. When the Bible describes violence, it does just that, recounts a historical narrative in which great violence did occur. Does that mean it sanctions those acts of violence? Absolutely not. You need to chop then, from your list, all the 'immoral' stuff that is just historical work, not divine commands. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; atheism is inherently a more moral position. newlinechar  newlinechar Where do morals come from in atheism? Where? Yourself? Well that seems like a mighty fine place to get your morals, seeing as human individuals are immutable, wise and undeceived.  newlinechar  newlinechar You also never really answered my point. How can you, as an atheist, even use the word 'moral' in an objective sense? Atheism necessitates moral relativism, therefore you are in no ways fit to critique anybody's morality other than your own.  newlinechar  newlinechar I don't see how a belief that says 'we are all just relatively advanced primates that have evolved recently whose only purpose is to propagate DNA and survive' gives you morality. newlinechar  newlinechar The belief that says we are all made in the image of a loving God who *is* love, endowed with inalienable rights to life, liberty and happiness, well, that is a moral landscape, as Sam Harris calls it.  newlinechar  newlinechar Here's a fun challenge.

&gt;The mind boggles. newlinechar  newlinechar Let me explain.   It is because this group has only one problem that I have with them.   That their majority (as shown by upvotes / etc)  seems to think that their obligation as an atheist is to be obnoxiously militant against other religions.     I agree, yeah,  some extreme sides of religions are at issue,   but not everyone is,  I'd even say most are not,  that way.       If the group didn't behave like an anal-retentive holier-than-thou hate group... then it wouldn't be like that for you.    I've no problem with individual atheists by any mean.   That's your choice,  believe or not believe what you wish.   But don't be offensive towards my beliefs...
That's not actually true.  A lot of the mainstream movement (Rep. Frank and HRC pop to mind) supported removing gender identity from ENDA with the hopes of getting that weaker version passed.  There was pretty strong community backlash, and both Frank and HRC changed their positions.  In subsequent Congresses, the ENDA bill has always included gender identity protections. newlinechar  newlinechar In defense of Frank's earlier position, you can't let the perfect be the enemy of the good.  A non-inclusive (not protecting trans*) ENDA would still protect millions more LGB people, which is a good, if not ideal, thing.  It would also give some ammunition to trans* people because of the LGB protections --- 'are you firing me because I'm trans* or are you firing me because I'm gay?'  In short, an inclusive ENDA would be the best case scenario, but I would still rather have a non-inclusive ENDA as law rather than the case today where we have no ENDA at all.

I understand. I'm wondering if maybe I was too harsh on Eslader. Hard to say... newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar I know there isn't an official Christianity, but all Christians base their religion on the teachings of the same book, given a few different versions of it. If they didn't, they wouldn't called themselves Christians, I don't imagine. They'd be Jewish, or Raëlians, or something else. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar That book is the source of that collection of forked religions, and that book is rather distasteful itself. Like I said, lots of really good people are Christians who simply ignore entire chunks of that book. Their religion is based on only part of it. If I, as an outsider, have to define Christianity in order to be able to say anything about it, then all I can go on is the book they all have in common. I can't dive into someone's head to figure out what parts of the book they like and what parts they ignore. Three of the largest religions on the planet all share a common ancestor in those stories. So, I'd have to say the Abrahamic religions can all by loosely defined (until corrected on a case-by-case basis) as being the results of those stories. So I feel perfectly valid in saying that religion in general, is bad.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar If I had a religion base on Mein Kampt, but just chose to ignore all the anti-Jewish parts, would you say that my religion is good? My disregard for the horrible parts of Mein Kampt who make me a good person, but the religion itself? No way. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar But that's ignoring the fact that simply believing in things for no good reason is bad too. It doesn't even address all the data showing where religious belief correlates with dysfunctional societies. I'm tired of religion being on a protected pedestal where people can hide it away from scrutiny and objection. Then if I don't share that belief, I have to shut up and let them do whatever they want because they have The One Truth and I don't.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar I don't like to attack people for being religious, but I'm happy to attack the concept of religion itself. If religion can't stand up to being criticised, then it isn't worthy of people devoting their lives to it. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Would you disagree with anything?

I can't say the same thing happened to me, but I had a similar experience. My senior year of high school I left a notebook in a classroom. Aside from class notes there was a list of equipment for my character in a military themed rpg. Needless to say, someone else found it and the administration freaked and pulled me out of class. I was questioned for 3 hours before I was let go. Similar circumstances, 3.25 gpa, no criminal record, 'good kid but a lonely dreamer' was how one teacher described me. I thought it was nothing, a stupid overreaction.  newlinechar  newlinechar Four years later I talk to an old classmate who revealed that while I was being questioned, another officer was asking the entire class about me. People I barely knew and had never wronged were lining up to talk about me being a psycho.

Really? The level of detail the show has and the fact that they start to deliver a joke, then literally wait an entire year to reveal the punchline is enough reason to call it a geeky show by itself. I must also mention Ted's entire character revolving around his love of one particular passion (architecture) and his constant need to find a woman who has seen Star Wars and who gets his references to Karate Kid. NPH's character also has the ultimate rich geek bachelor pad, complete with life-sized stormtrooper statue, and alphabetized porn collection. The show even creates it's own pop culture references within the show that never go away, like the fact that Robin used to be a Canadian pop star. newlinechar  newlinechar No, I wouldn't say that the show bills itself as a geeky show like Big Bang, nor is it a sci-fi or other genre show like Walking Dead, or Doctor Who, but it is a show which most modern geeks can relate to. Especially due to the amount of backstory they've created with a dozen flashbacks per episode, and with little to no retcons in sight! And these are what make it so much better than shows that say 'Hey look! We just made a science joke! We're geeks! Please like our show! Please?' (Big Bang Theory anyone?)

And yet piracy persists.  I agree that steam should be evaluated by more than just what it does to discourage piracy and that steam is an amazing distribution channel, my point is that when you evaluate steam through the lens of what impact it is having on piracy, the verdict is 'little to no impact'.   Hollywood may make good money from a steam type system and may be dropping the ball by not doing so, but it seems very unlikely that a steam system for Hollywood would have any impact on pirating of movies.

Look at Steam.  Look at how I can conveniently download almost every game released in the last decade.  Look at how I own the license to that product for life.  Look at how it keeps track of everything I've ever purchased, and allows me to redownload it again.  Look at how I can access my media from any computer I want.

This is a really common experience for someone who is new to anal sex.  The reason this happens is because the brain hasn't yet adjusted to seeing the anus as an erogenous zone.  I mean think about it, the only sensations she's ever experienced anally would be the sensation of needing to poop.  The brain doesn't know any better then to interpret your fingers as the same thing.  Don't worry though there are ways to make this easier.  I tend to think of anal sex as something that is more of an acquired taste such as coffee.  Some people like it immediately, some need to get used to it to like it, and some may never like it at all.  To help 'acquire' a taste for anal stimulation the best thing you can ever do is to stimulate her clitoris while simultaneously stimulating her ass.  If you can bring her to orgasm while she has fingers or a butt plug in her ass it will allow her brain to rewire itself to associate anal stimulation with pleasure.  Think of it similarly to when people add sugar to coffee.  The sugar sweetens it and makes it easier to drink and then eventually the person will start to love the rich bitter flavor of the coffee itself.  Anal sex works this way for most people in the beginning.  Try combining clitoral and anal stimulation and see where it takes you.  I did this in the beginning when I was getting into anal and I discovered that the additional anal stimulation makes my clitoral orgasms incredibly powerful and more intense, now I can get enough of anal stimulation.

I think keeping 'celebrity' players on a team roster is completely counter intuitive to growing the foreign scene.

So this guy also wrote about  [Florence](http://www.newworldeconomics.com/archives/2007/061707.htm), where I happen to live. The centre of Florence is made of extremely narrow streets and he loves it. I can tell you that it's nice when you are a tourist but it sucks to live in central Florence. It's almost impossible (and often illegal) to drive there and there are barely any buses, which makes it extremely difficult for handicapped people to live there for example. Also there are NO GREEN AREAS whatsoever besides Boboli (where you nhave to pay to get in, and Cascine, which is kind of far away), there simply is no space. Want to sit down on a bench somewhere? Too bad, there are none. If you want to get from point A to B you have to elbow your way through koreans with cameras and drunken american teenagers, it's not much better than driving through NYC. Also the traffic just outside the center is simply awful, heavy and dangerous. That said, it's one of the most beautiful cities in the world. But it's the opposite of liveable and sustainable.

I'll weigh in here.  Engineers don't need to know why something works, only that it does.  Why is a triangle the most stable 2 dimensional shape?

A) How would the CBC support itself financially and still maintain its services without public funding? It would either be forced to become 100% privately owned, or severely cut back on its services (and competitiveness). I don't think it's very likely that CBC would be able to survive on donations like PBS, either. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar B) I've yet to see anything on CTV that rivals programs like The Fifth Estate, and the excellent shows on CBC radio. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar C) Sun News probably wouldn't become Canada's most popular TV news network if CBC disappeared, but the loss of the CBC certainly wouldn't cost them any viewers. I chose to use Sun News Network as an example, as they have been the most vicious and loudest voice of criticism towards the CBC since their network was created. (Even though Sun News Network also receives money from the government. Half a billion dollars, in fact!) OP's link is a fine example of this. Check out the [Sun News website](http://www.sunnewsnetwork.ca/) if you want to see some real scaremongering.

I think the ignoring may come from the fact that American tourists are notorious for being incredibly ignorant of the cultures they are visiting.  Why would you visit China (or anywhere) and expect everyone to speak your foreign language?  I personally believe that if your going to visit a country then you should adhere to their cultural standards, not the other way around.
'Hence' actually means 'from here'. English used to have a way of showing a sort of 'direction' in places (direction was the best word I could think of for this). So 'hence', 'whence', and 'thence' mean 'from here', 'from where', and 'from there' respectively. 'Hither', 'whither', and 'thither' mean 'to here', 'to where', and 'to there', respectively. While 'here', 'where', and 'there' originally meant something like 'at here', 'at where', and 'at there'. Many Scandinavian languages preserve these place/direction distinctions, but they were pretty much lost in English along time ago except for a few set phrases eg 'come hither'.
&gt; The McDowell team studied 556 rape allegations.  Of that total, 256 could not be conclusively verified as rape.  That left 300 authenticated cases of which 220 were judged to be truthful and 80, or 27%, were judged as false.  In his report Charles McDowell stated that extra rigor was applied to the investigation of potentially false allegations.  To be considered false one or more of the following criteria had to be met: the victim unequivocally admitted to false allegation, indicated deception in a polygraph test, and provided a plausible recantation.  Even by these strict standards, slightly more than one out of four rape charges were judged to be false. newlinechar  newlinechar From the IPT citation.  They apparently did follow up studies with civilian populations before the issue got too hot to research which is probably where the 40% figure comes from. newlinechar  newlinechar In any event, I think your assertion that the original research doesn't exist is conclusively disproven.  It may have been a crock of shit for all we know, but it certainly exists.

I agree with you the concept is appealing. The problem is reality.

Depends on what you want to do.  In general, the anode (red) raises the resting membrane potential of the underlying cortex, making it 'easier' for those neurons to fire.  So, you can say that the anode helps to turn on the brain area under it.  The cathode does the opposite.  Note that the electrodes shouldn't actually be causing the neurons to fire, they're just making it easier (or harder) for those neurons to fire.  To give you an example, putting the anode over primary visual cortex (right above that bump on the back of your head, called the inion) is supposed to lower your contrast detection threshold, so that you can theoretically see things that would otherwise be too low contrast to see (see e.g. Antal, Nitche, &amp; Paulus, 2001).   newlinechar  newlinechar You can put the other electrode (the reference electrode) kind of anywhere you want, but it needs to be at least 8 centimeters from the active electrode or you'll just shunt current through the skin and it will really have no effect.  Also, extra-cephalic (not-on-the-head) reference electrodes can be good depending on what you want to do, just don't put it too close to the chest cavity to avoid cardiac effects: contralateral deltoid muscle is a popular extra-cephalic reference location.  This way, you don't end up inhibiting something else in the brain.  You can also use a larger sponge for the reference electrode, which will exponentially diminish the current density.  Also, sponges that don't have a lot of holes in them are better -- they create uniform current density and avoid hotspots, which can be uncomfortable or even cause scalp irritation. newlinechar  newlinechar So... if you want to mess with vision/contrast detection, put the active electrode on the back of your head, about 3cm above the inion.  If you want to mess with motion detection in the presence of noise, put it 3cm up and 5cm lateral (over V5/MT).  If you want to mess with working memory or problem solving, a frontal or even prefrontal location is more appropriate.  Many papers refer to the [international 10-20 EEG system](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/10-20_system_(EEG)) when reporting their electrode locations, so if you find a paper whose effects you want to replicate/try out, that's a good place to start.   newlinechar  newlinechar I'm seriously going to put this at the bottom of many of my posts, though: DON'T DO THIS UNLESS YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING!  :)

You obviously haven't done enough meth. That bad joke aside, one of my ex-wives was like this for a long period of time while we were still dating and then even after we moved in together. She occasionally let loose a little 'pip' but no real rip snorters. Then, one night, she was asleep on her stomach next to me on the bed wearing nothing but her surgical scrub bottoms as I was sitting up by her watching TV quietly. She let one rip, a real brawler of a fart. The sound was awesome, the smell was quite eye watering but the absolute best part was seeing the back of her surgical scrubs flap like a flag in a class 5 hurricane. I laughed so hard it woke her up, and it was difficult to explain to her why I was laughing through the gasps for air and the crying from laughter. Once I was able to choke it out she got red and started (playfully) hitting my arm. Good times...

Like I mentioned above, funds were terribly misused by DPS and the evidence is locked up in 'storage rooms' the size of classes.

It really depends. If someone has a genuine point, I am happy to admit when I am wrong, but this is one of those cases where the OP is using /r/AskReddit to make a point about their opinion instead of asking any real question, in which case I am happy to play debate-club and take the opposing argument. 
The rule to remember is that each separate thing of the 'and' should be able to stand alone in a correct sentence.  For example 'took of picture of I' isn't right.  'Took a picture of me' is right, so the correct form to be used in the sentence with the 'and' is 'took a picture of my girlfriend and me'.
I don't know why everyone complains about this. Would you expect to be able to use the same weight room as varsity athletes all the time? The school dishes out large amount of money for these teams so they should get priority on the facilities. Many of the sports teams have 6 AM lifts to accommodate everyone. 
Assuming there's another way to get around quickly and efficiently, I think that taking the cars out of a city would make it better 'automatically.'

I don't think it makes any sense at all. It demonstrates a very simple-minded and unintelligent approach to punishment. While I could understand reservations about handing him a prescription pad, this is somebody with a skillset that very few people have. It would be absolutely idiotic to deny him a license without so much as thinking about it, and other countries will recognize that if the United States does not.  I agree that he should be punished, and probation + a fine sounds fair, but a lifetime ban for a first-time offense made by someone who was being young and stupid is hardly sensible, especially if he didn't harm anybody. If he does it again, I completely agree that you should toss every book you have at him, but this type of ban presumes that nobody ever learns from their mistakes.  newlinechar  newlinechar As an American posting this from overseas, reading stories like this one make me quite sad - it's almost as if the USA doesn't want skilled workers within their borders, because laws like this one force the talent to look elsewhere. 
Right - but... *why* is the city car-friendly?  Obviously some people want it that way.  newlinechar  newlinechar Saying that if the city were not car friendly then people wouldn't live out of the city, approaches tautology. The interesting bit is, *why is it the way it is?*   newlinechar  newlinechar Some people suggest it is clever marketing by Ford and GM that created the roads and infrastructure that allowed people to move out. The idea suggests that people are really not being rational when they move out to the burbs. Instead, they've been duped. I don't agree with this. newlinechar  newlinechar I think people like to live away from the crowds. They like to live in a place where there is order and calm, and there is an absence of commerce. (the proverbial 'bedroom community'). The city cannot be that place. The ultimate embodiment of this ideal is a remote village where nothing big ever happens, but there are no jobs in such places. So people compromise, and decide to live in the burbs.  And they convince the powers that be to provide infrastructure that allows them to work in the bustling city. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; If the barrier was increased,  newlinechar  newlinechar Yes, but who would increase it?  The people obviously don't want that. They don't want barriers.  People don't want to be controlled.  newlinechar  newlinechar There is something that pushes people OUT of the city. The noise, trash, crime, crowds,  disorder, or some combination (I'm guessing. Really I'm just projecting my own preferences on the entire world). It's no good forcing people to live in a place. A better approach is to attract the people to live there. Find out what makes them run away, and fix it.  Fix the crime, fix the noise, or whatever it is.  newlinechar  newlinechar 150 years ago, cities didn't have electric advertisements operating 24 hours a day.  Cities had gaslights and when dusk came, things quieted down.  By my way of thinking, it turns out that the city of 1850 fit the humans.  But when we turned cities into commercial centers that never stopped, we created a sort of deranged place to live.  Who wants to live where you need bars on your windows, and there's trash on your front stoop,  three mornings out of seven? newlinechar  newlinechar I am no expert, though. This is just my opinion.

In July 2010 I got an assignment from Nike to shoot LeBron right after his TV special announcing his move to the Heat. We rented the Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena, where the Lakers and the Clippers used to play, and there were 53 people on my crew -- including hair and makeup artists, production people, a stylist. I had $10,000 in Hollywood lighting. It was huge. When LeBron arrived, it was as if Nelson Mandela had come in. Six or seven blacked-out Escalades pulled up, a convoy. LeBron had bodyguards and his masseuse. His deejay was already there, blasting. This for a photo shoot that was going to last an hour, tops. newlinechar &gt; newlinechar &gt;**This is how crazy it was: I wasn't even allowed to talk directly to LeBron.

Funny you should say that, it's a very good observation that most people don't think about when they talk about a personal defense weapon. Yes, reliability is super important.  newlinechar  newlinechar But then again, when your gun jams in a dire situation, if you've trained enough, then you've gotten jams and learned to quickly clear them. So make sure you shoot a lot.  newlinechar  newlinechar I wouldn't buy a Kel Tech, but some people have to operate on a budget. That being said, you will have a certain break-in time. Put at least 200 rounds down-range, even in a Kel Tech, and that should help with issues. The parts just need some wear. This may not be so true for a very high quality gun, I would consider a Dan Wesson 1911 to be such a weapon.  newlinechar  newlinechar That being said, when you do buy one if you have any issues, especially with something like a Sig, take it back to the shop you bought it from and maybe they can detect a problem.  newlinechar  newlinechar If you're really about reliability, you should take a look at some revolvers when you go to the range. I remember seeing a revolver called the Rhino that placed the barrel at the 6 o'clock cylinder position. It also had a weird cylinder that was squared off on the sides so that it was flattish for a revolver. I haven't heard if it has been successful, but it was certainly interesting. I think they had a .357 version, 6 shots. Good caliber.  newlinechar  newlinechar The other issue to think about that is a bit more advanced and it's probably something you should feel for when you test some guns out, rather than me butcher an explanation, but there is a difference between what's called single action and double action. It relates to the way the trigger interacts with the striker/hammer. Just google Single Action vs Double Action.   newlinechar  newlinechar 
Aaahh, heh. Thanks mang. 
Well, there's no real science that says Christianity can not accept evolution. It's similar to the Big-Bang theory in that the chruch accepts both. The Catholic Church accepts both theories. Several other groups of christians don't, but what can you do? newlinechar  newlinechar The Pope says that God was the original spark for -and the driving force of- evolution. I don't share this view, but this sounds like what you're going for. newlinechar  newlinechar If you don't believe the pope is the Vicar of Christ, or you have a problem with God of the Gaps, I can't really help you. If you want to stop reading here, that's fine.  newlinechar  newlinechar The evolutionary model is hardly linear, however. newlinechar  newlinechar you could have any number of mutations occuring at the same time. newlinechar using the same setup... newlinechar  newlinechar [Original creature] + (Change, where different numbers = diff changes) = [resultant creature] newlinechar  newlinechar 2+ (1) = 3 newlinechar  newlinechar 2+ (2) = 4 newlinechar  newlinechar 2+ (3) = 5 newlinechar  newlinechar 2+ (4) = 6 newlinechar  newlinechar from there, lets say, the change (3) didn't work in the creature's favour. In fact, it made it more likely to be predated on, so it is wiped out. newlinechar  newlinechar In addition, (2) was a benign mutation. It was neither beneficial nor negative. newlinechar  newlinechar from there we have newlinechar  newlinechar 2 + (1) = 3 newlinechar  newlinechar 2 + (2) = 4* newlinechar  newlinechar 2 + (3) = ~~5~~ newlinechar  newlinechar 2 + (4) = 6 newlinechar  newlinechar This could continue on. Say, 6 has another series of small changes, not all of which are successful. newlinechar  newlinechar 6 + (5) = 11 newlinechar  newlinechar 6 + (6) = ~~12~~ newlinechar  newlinechar 6 + (7) = 13 newlinechar  newlinechar 6 + (8) = ~~14~~ newlinechar  newlinechar Then 11 and 13 would go on to mutate further. At some point, the changes would be so drastic that a descendent of 6 would look almost nothing like a descendant of say, 3. It might even look something like [this.](http://humanorigins.si.edu/evidence/human-fossils/species/human-family-tree) newlinechar  newlinechar There is in fact a physical point where a creature could in theory not become 'more red', or 'more poisonous'. That's the asymtote you're thinking of. newlinechar  newlinechar And this is why I don't call people stupid. Sometimes they're ignorant (Lacking knowledge, information, or awareness about something in particular: 'ignorant of astronomy'.)

I dunno . . even people who spend all their time thinking about 'shallow' things are still, well, people.  They're still incredibly complex, amazing, sometimes passionate creatures.

Yeah, the things they think about may not be *relevant* to us, and they may not be all that *deep* by our thinking, but they're still *important* in a way because they're constantly shaping a real *person*. newlinechar  newlinechar And people are always important. newlinechar  newlinechar So a lot of people might not be all that interesting or relevant.

Unfortunately, many high schoolers are criticized for speaking their minds as any teenager would.  However, working in a high school where bullying, gangs, students with serious family issues, and just plain old drama exists all the time, any threat observed and reported has to be assessed.  It is a (unfair) balance of making sure the school doesn't miss anything that could incriminate them later if something were to happen, but also to make sure that students are safe. The second element is extremely important.  newlinechar  newlinechar You definitely should not have been kicked out of school and forced to go to jail. The 'Columbine effect' has unfairly led to increased suspension, expulsion, and jail time for teenagers, which ultimately leads to pretty fucked up lives for a lot of people. Although your situation was not fair and the school should have handled it far differently, I have hope because at least in the school I work in, the culture is shifting to how to restoratively fix problems without taking students out of school.   newlinechar  newlinechar If the school had handled it appropriately, the social worker should have assessed that you were being bullied and have focused on working through that problem and adequately supporting you with any other academic/family problems.   newlinechar  newlinechar Sorry you had to go through that.

If anybody gives a shit, this contains spoilers for Star Wars I, II and III. newlinechar  newlinechar There is such a thing as middle ground. Too little talk and you don't further the plot in any meaningful way, too much talk and you start talking in platitudes. Darth Maul did not receive any development as a character - he was just there to look menacing (hence the title). newlinechar  newlinechar And it is because of this lack of development that we never get a feeling that the Sith are truly important. So much time is spent on various fight scenes that this whole Darth Maul business is minor. So we never get properly invested in the legend of the Sith. We don't value the significance of his defeat (the Jedi hoped their mortal enemies for millennia were finally ended), so we aren't filled with any sort of [Dramatic Irony](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irony#Dramatic_irony) at their unjustified hope. newlinechar  newlinechar Major opportunities were missed, and many of them could have been covered by some level of conversation with Darth Maul.

I agree with most of the comments here — in short, it's not a privilege because it's not perpetuated by society. But there are a couple of ways in which it's similar to a privilege. newlinechar  newlinechar If you're naturally good at something, you might be unable to understand the experience of being bad at it. I've got very good pitch (mother's a choral director), so I don't really know what it means to be tone-deaf. That means I shouldn't be dismissive of the experiences of others ('You just listen to it and sing it back. It's not that complicated!'). newlinechar  newlinechar It also means that if I wanted to become a music teacher, I wouldn't be a very good one unless I had some sort of empathy with the tone-deaf, and an awareness of how to work around the talent deficiencies I never had. newlinechar  newlinechar (I've long wondered whether Peyton Manning will go into coaching, and how good of a coach he would be if he did. Not all good players are good coaches, and though Peyton's a brilliant tactician, I can imagine him getting impatient when coaching quarterbacks whose instincts just aren't as good as his.) newlinechar  newlinechar Anyway, here's the point: though talent isn't a privilege, it's perhaps similar enough to privilege in certain ways that it could be a useful parable to explain the privilege concept to others.

I understand what you are saying about the forcing you to play differently, such as tryndemere, but I don't see why people ban things like ahri. I also have a question if you dont mind. Is it versitility or power that causes potency in this game? I never see brand banned, or veigar, even though they burst extremely hard. 
I'm a kind of active person in a group of Homestucks in my area called the Atlstucks (mostly late teens, early 20s). They've done several meetups where they rented out an off season haunted house as a place to hang out at and were allowed to turn part of it into a dance area. They also do outside park meetups, however we're in georgia, it's much warmer here, but those become an option for you in the spring and summer. Their next meetup is at a bowling alley where I hear they got a really good group deal (I dont know how good since im not going, but from the sound of it, its a *really good deal*)

Fred,  newlinechar You seem to have good insight on one of my biggest problems, and I thought maybe you could shed some light on my biggest problem - motivation.  newlinechar  newlinechar You say that some women feel like toxic energy saps, and I couldnt agree more with that. My problem is that I seem to be meeting girls who dont stimulate me at all mentally. Because of that, I feel like there is nothing to learn from them. I give value, and get none in return. So I have a similar lack of interest because I feel like the reward isn't worth the effort. I have some FWBs set up, so now mostly I feel like I'm just waiting for someone of value to drop into my lap. newlinechar  newlinechar Im using a sniper rifle while I should be carpet bombing, and we all know here that that doesn't work.

You're absolutely right, I did learn a lot.  newlinechar  newlinechar But now I'm home and I'm lost. I dont want to fall back into my loop like before, I want to be constantly improving. Yet I always feel like Im better off doing work or calling a FWB because of how low my success rate is, with success being defined by quality women.   newlinechar  newlinechar How do you drive yourself to keep doing this, even when so often the outcome seems to be negative?
Many believe, rightly or wrongly, that veganism is a mode of eating based on morality rather than nature, and that this unnatural mode of eating is actually less healthy than forms of eating that include animal products.

I was born in Belgrade in the late 80s, Serbia has been a mess my entire life. The scariest thing for me was the NATO bombings in the late 90s, I had a lot of family that had to stay away from major buildings and hope they wouldn't get blown up. It's scary to have your home attacked for something you have no control over like that. newlinechar  newlinechar I had two haunting experiences that still stick with me. The first one was seeing a hotel in New Belgrade (yeah, there's a new Belgrade), that was several stories tall, with a giant crater where a bomb hit. When I saw it, a few years passed already and it was just an abandoned hotel that's partially exploded. There was no effort to fix any of it (what money?), it just stood there like some war relic. And it didn't look like some tiny hotel nobody cared about, it could have at least been a source of jobs for a few people. newlinechar  newlinechar The next one was walking with my cousins by the river and them telling me that this was where they waited for the bombings to stop every night. I was there and saw the whole city just taking up my view, and I remembered watching the tv coverage at the time and seeing everything going to hell. I was so mad at everything, I hated that people I loved were just trying to live their life and getting attacked. newlinechar  newlinechar This rambled, and I know other countries have it worse, but I still remember it all every day and it sucks
Depends on the species. The most logical explanation is that they're looking for food and/or shelter. Flying is energetically expensive, as is keeping warm, so they wouldn't be flying to keep warm. It sounds like possibly a flock of starlings, cedar waxings, or some species of blackbird. All of which are highly social in winter and would form large flocks. Given the size, I'd probably wager that they're some species of blackbird. I hope this helps.

You could try eating them.
There have been a few past situations, where i end up at restaurants who forcibly collectivize the bill.  There are always those people who order everything on the menu.    Eventually I stopped ordering any food at those places in order to be left out of the bill. newlinechar  newlinechar Despite (or because?) of my athletic figure, it would have been easy for me to exploit the situation as well, eating much larger and more expensive quantities of food, realizing that for each extra dollar of food I order, I would only be liable for about ten-cents. newlinechar  newlinechar Spread that out to government, and collecting an unemployment check might cost me....  1 cent?
I'm not exactly sure what that means...?

Crushing loss, to be sure.  I tend to agree with the overriding sentiment that, as it is with a win, a loss is the result of a TEAM effort.  Seeing all the Superbowl hype and thinking how close we were to being one of the teams in the middle of it is hard.  I thought I had 'moved on' past the Championship loss but it turns out I didn't.  I watched the game again last night and it kills me that there are so many little plays (drops, stumbles in a hole, almost stripped balls, etc) that could have put US in Indy.  FUCK!!!!   newlinechar  newlinechar But I digress.  The hurt I felt on Championship Sunday was NOTHING like the hurt I felt in 1991 when the Giants beat us on a last minute filed goal in the NFC Championship game and went on to beat the Bills in Superbowl XXV (Thanks to Norwood's 'Wide Right' kick).  That was the hardest day in my life as a Niner fan.  Had we won that game we would have been the first (and to this day ONLY) team to Three-pete.   newlinechar  newlinechar That team in '91 was EXPECTED to go to the playoff's.  That team was EXPECTED to go to the NFC Championship Game.  That team was EXPECTED to win the Superbowl.   newlinechar  newlinechar The 2011 squad wasn't EXPECTED to do shit.  We HOPED we'd finish .500, we thought MAYBE we'd get to the playoffs.  We PRAYED the rest of the NFC West would collapse.   newlinechar  newlinechar 13 - 3?  2nd Place in the NFC?  NFC Championship appearance?  If you REALLY saw this coming you should go to Vegas. newlinechar  newlinechar I love the Niners, have my whole life, but now that the dust has settled and the sharp bite of the loss has dulled a little; I look back at the GAME vs. the Giants as a LOSS but the 2011 SEASON....it's a victory.

Say you have future knowledge of a person. You know that he will murder 300 people if you don’t stop him. You also have the future knowledge that nothing else would work to stop him but to kill him 3 weeks before the acts would occur. Do you consider this self-defense, even though you aren’t one going to be one of the victims? Is this you stepping in to help someone, even though it is 3 weeks before the event? Such an absurd situation is, while highly implausible, not impossible to conceive. Therefore, how can murder be “simply” wrong? For a further used example, if you could go back in time and murder hitler, would you? Many would say yes and believe it to be an absolutely moral act. newlinechar  newlinechar If you want to argue murder is wrong, justify this belief with logic.

I just want to point out... federal law dictates that if the company really can't afford to pay someone on maternity leave, they have every right to not hold your position while you are unable to perform your duties. It seems like this is exactly what was happening. newlinechar  newlinechar Your posts didn't seem to indicate too strongly whether or not you agreed with the policy you were describing, but it seemed to be written to imply that the policy was unfair and in fact predatory, superiors looking for any reason they can to fire you. newlinechar  newlinechar Situations like this are an unfortunate consequence of getting pregnant and the realities of running a company. If the company can't afford it, they can't afford it, and it's not unfair for them to not keep the position available once you are not able to meet your duties. newlinechar  newlinechar Edit: It appears as if OP is in Germany, so obviously federal law would be irrelevant.

I think something most people don't realize is when you are arrested and *charged* during a raid, you also end up paying restitution. (I could be wrong in the term) So not only do you get all your stuff seized but you also end up having to pay back the amount of the raid *and* the processing of the stuff they seized. An old neighbor of mine in Polk County, FL had his son busted at his house who was growing two plants in his room (unkown to him).  newlinechar  newlinechar They seized his son's car, $2,200 in cash (savings, he wasn't selling, it was for personal use) and his son ended up owing over $15k in fines and fees to cover the raid. Come to find out it was his girlfriend who called the cops after a nasty breakup, not realizing it'd be much much more than a slap on the wrist.  newlinechar  newlinechar My buddy ended up having to foot most of the bill because his son was 17, plus having to pay repairs for a broken door, window and new carpet from the smell of the flashbang they threw.

I feel you but it seems like people really like contributing their own opinion and through these opinions try new games then pass that along so on and so forth.  Also a lot of new subscribers everyday so many new folks to the subreddit want to get a feel of things and so far people have been super great at helping out.  newlinechar  newlinechar  If it gets to some unbearable top ten list frontpage then I can see making some compromises or as you said doing a sticky for it.  Maybe we can even eventually have quarterly best game/system/genre for applicable systems or genres.  Just brainstorming but it's users like you that drum up discussion and we always appreciate it.

Cool, I never knew about that, thanks.  But I do have a rebuttal/question.  Keep in mind this is very much outside of my field. newlinechar  newlinechar In vulcanized rubber, are ALL the polymers crosslinked? Or most? or just a few?  I was thinking that softer rubber, like car tires, could be cut more easily because there are fewer cross-links, whereas it would be more difficult (but still possible) to cut a hockey puck or bowling ball.  Is this because there are fewer paths for the knife to go to avoid breaking a covalent bond?  Or are there other factors that cause the difference in hardness? newlinechar  newlinechar Also, could you consider a big lump of vulcanized rubber to be one molecule?
That's true. Not sure how nice that would look for me though.

&gt; That would be one hell of a court case. newlinechar  newlinechar I doubt it. Imagine this bill was in effect. They pass, like they did in 2005, an Iraq war spending bill and a minimum wage increase in the same bill. It passes, things go on. newlinechar  newlinechar Then a store owner doesn't want to pay $8/hr to his employees, it'd put him out of business. So he refuses. He's fined, goes to court, and states that the minimum wage increase should not be valid because it's in breech of OSaaT rule. Judge looks at it, decides it is, and grants the injunction against the minimum wage law. Now Congress simply has to go back and pass a new minimum wage law that can be the exact same measures, just as its own bill. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; This bills only have teeth if everyone agrees to follow them newlinechar  newlinechar I'm not sure I understand. As long as it's law and the court recognizes someone's right to appeal a law on the grounds that it was passed in breech of OSaaT, then it has teeth, whether 'every' agrees to follow them or not. That's why this 'law' would have teeth vs a parliamentary procedural 'rule'

Hm, maybe. newlinechar  newlinechar I'm really not sure though. In the past it's been easy to just ban things like women wearing pants. Gender roles were legally and institutionally enforced. Family law was explicitly sexist, so was labour law, and so on. Much of this still goes on, and obviously feminism doesn't always win every battle, but sexism is under concerted and persistent attack, as it ought to be. newlinechar  newlinechar Jean Baudrillard argued that power and the hegemony of the dominant ideology in our society was becoming more and more self-imposed and decentralized. The toy thing I mentioned really bothered me when I first heard about it; if you walk into any toy store now they often don't even label the 'boys' and 'girls' sections, they're *colour-coded*. Toys really used to be pretty gender-neutral. That's not something that was 'there the whole time'. newlinechar  newlinechar I'm sure you're right to some extent, of course there have been for a very long time informal, cultural, self-reinforcing mini-structures that serve to replicate gender stereotyping, but I'm wondering if there is a sort of increased decentralizing tendency in sexism that is actively making it even harder to pin down and exterminate. newlinechar  newlinechar At any rate, I'd be fascinated to really see the subject given a thorough treatment.

There are many different situations that could present, most of the problem crocs were on massive stations (approx 350,000acres) were they would have many different water volumes (billabongs). The most common trap for the large crocdiles was to put out a kangaroo leg or animal of the sort and tie if off (with 50mtrs) of VB cord to a tree. On the cord we would run empty water bottles (floats) so we could trace the croc. We would leave the trap over night and head back in the morning. newlinechar  newlinechar With smaller crocs (fresh water) we would run big nets across the shallow billabongs.

I don't see how. The tyranny of the majority doesn't need this bill. It would push through it's stuff regardless of if each bill had to be one subject or not. Today's compromise is a result of two things: 1) merging multiple topics into a single vote is 'easy' to explain to angry constituents ('Why did you vote for that Iraq war spending bill?' 'Well, you see, I was simply voting to increase the minimum wage for our poor.') and 2) the fact that the current push is 'to get things done' and 'bipartisanship' and 'reaching across the aisle'. The idea that one side would be able to run roughshod over the other side doesn't require this bill to happen.  newlinechar  newlinechar If anything, this rule would make it harder to pull off. Instead of simply tossing crumbs to the minority: 'I want to increase counterterrorism measures. Ok, I'll give you 0.1% budget increase.' and then pretending that it is 'bipartisan', they would have to actually deal with both bills separately.

God will do whatever is in His will- and from an objective view point, it can definitely look like a dick move by God.

You can clap your hands right now and that's your choice.  newlinechar  newlinechar God puts us through trials for a whole lot of reasons. He definitely wants us to grow.

If God just gave us what we wanted, like no pain and suffering- there would be no relationship with God, and we would not be able to love as much as we do. God would simply become our servant as we direct him to what we want. There is no growth, there is no relationship, there is no love. Only immediate desires met, which would make us the god instead of God the god (if that makes sense).

Terrapins and/or slider turtles only really eat live foods or prey normally when they are juveniles. Not to say they won't at all as adults, especially if they are starved or hungry.

You have to be commiting another crime in order to be pulled over. Now that can be speeding, 'driving recklessly' which doesn't really require evidence or anything else the police can claim. The huge difference is the search.

Let me tell you a story. I was sitting on a bench with a couple friends on a friday night and this really fuckin drunk guy walks over and sits on the bench next to us. He was barely able to sit up and smelled of booze. He started to pass out and we thought nothing of it. newlinechar  newlinechar Then some lady comes by and asks if he's alright and we say yea we think so he's just drunk. She tries to wake him but can't, does the chest rub with no response, she calls 911 and it turns out the guy was also diabetic and going into a diabetic coma, he lived because someone called 911. if they hadn't he would have sat on that bench fell into a coma and would have died. newlinechar  newlinechar The main point is that someone passed out in their own vomit in a public restroom IS NOT NORMAL. IT'S NOT FUNNY. and you should call 911 in those circumstances. Even if he was simply passed out, it's better not to take that chance. You can either seek help for the person, or risk not doing anything having the person die, and carry that with you knowing you could have stopped it, if you just did the right thing. That's really not something you want on your mind, as it surely would stay there for a very long time.  newlinechar  newlinechar In my case, I learned this lesson with that experience.  newlinechar  newlinechar also one more thing, the guy could have possibly overdosed on another drug, as drug addicts are known to shoot up and do various other deadly drugs in public restrooms. Shit there are probably dozens of fatal health problems that could cause someone to pass out and throw up. Wise up son.

I'm glad to hear you can afford to buy a game whenever you choose; I am not in the same situation. When they decide to release six big games all within the span of of two weeks, it kinda sucks figuring out which one (or maybe two you want). But then to buy the game and find out, 'There's 15 other items that aren't included because you didn't buy it three months in advance. But good news, you can spend an additional $10 to unlock all of that!' It's kind of annoying.  newlinechar  newlinechar When I buy a game, I want it in it's entirety, not stripped down.

They apparently asked her to call me after whatever he did with the IP address I gave him didn't work, and she said 'Nope, I'm done with this.' Other then that, not much other then some comments about how I was a jackass, or how I should be more helpful, and stop trying to use technical jargon to get out of doing work, and other similarly silly things. newlinechar  newlinechar My landlady didn't say much because as soon as I got off the phone with Derpette, I gave her (my landlady's) husband a call (he's our contact since she's usually busy) and explained what happened. He apologized that I had been contacted at all for what was obviously an internal company issue. After a few minutes of talking about it we decided that the best solution was just to get a dedicated broadband connection for the apartment so I wouldn't need to piggy back off their network.  newlinechar  newlinechar I don't think anything happened to Mr. Derp since I saw his truck out front just a few weeks ago. I'd offer to do their IT work for them, but I have rules against shitting where I eat.
The economist recently ran an interesting article in which the british parliament was accused of avoiding the issue.  What Scotts really want it more control, not total independence.  Parliament is offering independence, *knowing that the scotts will almost certainly vote it down,* rather than offering any middle option which would pass without difficulty.

I don't understand what you are doing by taking the 7 cosets. Are you saying that if 2^5*7&gt;2^7 then there IS an error-correcting code or there isn't? newlinechar  newlinechar Or if I took the same steps for dimension 4 and did 2^4*7 &lt; 2^7 and I know that's true so it works for dimension 4?
I know exactly why I believe in God. I'm not here to convert you or anything. You not believing in God has no bearing on my life at all. My only thing is you deem all theists incapable of rational thinking, when there are billions of other rational thoughts that someone could have other than the existence of a higher power.  newlinechar  newlinechar I shouldn't have to defend my beliefs either, but I'll humor you. My believing in God is that I think that there is a higher power who created the universe and all within it. Do I believe in evolution? Of course. Dinosaurs? Sure. Darwinism? Yes.  newlinechar  newlinechar This does not contradict my religion, as it doesn't preach creationism, but I believe a higher power did orchestrate the process that made life what it is now. newlinechar  newlinechar You don't need to be such a condescending ass in your questioning, by the way. It makes you seem pretty close-minded, an attribute that many atheists pin on theists, ironically enough.
The difference is that the linear sequence in FFXIII is designed to *thoroughly* teach the system to the player.   newlinechar  newlinechar Sure, the designers spent far, far too long teaching the game with slowly increasing complexity instead of letting us play it, but that is the downside of releasing an FF game in the age of Triple A titles.  It had to be accessible, and they fell into the trap trying to make the game playable to the average idiot, who would have gotten bored of it after a few hours anyway.  I'm not defending this decision, but I am defending the design intention.  It was specifically made to be a certain way, to match the battle system which to me is one of the best ever made.  It's just not to everyones tastes. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;If I played the first 10 chapters of that game repeatedly, it would be exactly the same, down to the amount of EXP my characters get. newlinechar  newlinechar You noticed this part, but if you pay attention you'll notice that the dungeons are intentionally designed to escalate your battles.  You'll fight one type of enemy, then two, then a different type, then a mix of the two types and so on, all in a very deliberate order.  This of course is only possible to do if your progression is linear.  There was an overly cautious focus on stepping the player through the mechanics of the game, again because I don't think the developers had confidence in some players picking up the stagger system. newlinechar  newlinechar Compare this to Call of Duty, which is the same skills being tested over and over again with more and more explosions.  There is no system to learn; you've mastered what needs to be mastered by the time you've finished the third level.

The difference is that the scientific model allows for reproduction. While I havnt done the expirement a lot of other people have. And it's not based on faith. If you have the same equipment and preform the test you will get the same results within an acceptable error.

I agree.  A lot of decisions have been going against us but eventually we're going to get some calls that throw things in our favor, that's how it works.

I hope I don't come off as a jerk here. I'm trying to be more polite on the internet. I'm going to try to cover your questions as asked. newlinechar  newlinechar First, it need not get to the point of use for the gun to have meaning. It's like how a strong poker hand helps you win a pot even if you never show it, or how the US has power due to owning nukes despite having never used one and not intending to if we can at all help it. newlinechar  newlinechar Rand is not against guns, she's against initiating violence (but not against fighting violence with violence). newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;So would there exist no police in an Ayn Rand fantasy world?? newlinechar  newlinechar There would likely be police. Though in a true 'fantasy world' everyone would agree with Rand and wouldn't take what they didn't earn or commit violence against someone else. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Or would there still be police, but without guns?? newlinechar  newlinechar There would presumably be police who only use guns against people who have initiated violence or theft against someone else. Rand believes you have a right to your own person and property that you earn through voluntary transactions. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Or would they have guns, but only point them at tax collecters?? newlinechar  newlinechar No. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;If I pointed a gun at your head, does the government have a right to point a gun at my head?? newlinechar  newlinechar Yes. Whether or not they have a right to shoot you for it is a more interesting question. I would consider a threat of that level to be violence. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Don't you need police to protect your private property?? newlinechar  newlinechar Not necessarily, but it's generally a pretty efficient method, yeah. eBay/PayPal is an example of a basically purely voluntary marketplace. While they involve police from time to time I'm sure, the bulk of their operation involves insurance and reputation. Thieves are generally shut out of the community rather than gone after with guns. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;If you do need police, how do you expect to pay them if your view of taxes as being comparable to murder is acknowledged by everyone, even the police who need to get paid somehow?? newlinechar  newlinechar You've completely eliminated the possibility of someone funding a police force out of their own free will. Whether or not people would be willing to do that is an interesting question, but to fail to even acknowledge the possibility is problematic.

in the individual class .cfg files you can unbind and bind any key you like. There is one catch, though.

Bullshit, I've heard you say in interviews you stream 8-10 hours a day.  Most of the Koreans play around the 8 hour mark plus breaks for lunch etc.  And if you want to talk skill, you are the most gimmicky player in the foreign scene with maybe catz and a few others right there with you.  You rely on infestors to win all games and can't really win any other way.  Shit you haven't advanced in an mlg, I can hardly understand why you would think you have any valid opinion on the Korean scene when you can't even play against foreigners.  Furthermore, you rely on your popularity the MOST of any player, more so than iNcontroL etc.  At least iNcontroL promotes esports, you just stream while cheesing for wins, or losing to better players than you when you play standard.  You rely on being racist and obnoxious to keep your viewer count, which is diminishing by the way.  Stephano even after the shit this week had 6k viewers over your 2k.

I still don't accept the 'Mechanics were harder' part. The AI was simply retarded, so you had to micromanage stuff. Now the AI is smarter and you don't have to use your APM to fix mistakes anymore. That APM is now free to do as you please. Would you consider 'the machincs harder' in an RTS game were you need to give every order yourself (attack, attack again, attack again, move, attack, attack, attack for every unit)? Probably not. You can A-move your units in BW and in SC2 but in both games you gain an upper hand if you micro them. Difference is in BW you need to stop units from doing stupid stuff (shooting at supply depots) while in SC2 you need to start using them better. newlinechar The game is the same, just got more fierce.

Thanks for taking the time to write this well thought out comment. You really did sum up the crux of the issue quite well. Perhaps it would be prudent to start a new thread in which we can propose guidelines for this subreddit. The 'How to ask for help' post that is now on the sidebar is really great, and something this sub has clearly been lacking for sometime (thanks hooplah!). I think as we come to a consensus about what types of behaviors are and are not welcomed, we can grow the sidebar and set out some guidelines for a functional community. I'm not thinking anything too prohibitive, but maybe it would be nice to have it spelled out on the sidebar that the intention of the sub is to give *advice* and that outfits posted will get critiques, and that critiques should be constructive. newlinechar  newlinechar ...Then again, I'm not sure how we could set out to do that without it devolving into name calling in the way these threads are want to do.

It doesn't make them any direct money, but it does often reward the employees who work there and own stock/stock options, which in turn sets up a positive incentive structure. For example, I happen to know that Amazon issues its employees direct stock (not options) as part of their yearly compensation.

&gt;That would be stupid. If you work as an exterminator you have to see bugs. My example is nothing so asinine. If you work in a typical retail store it's not an expectation that your job will be 100% ladder work if you are afraid of heights. newlinechar  newlinechar Who said anything about 100%? 'I'll deal with the ants, termites, roaches, bees, wasps, hornets, and rats, but can someone take 5 minutes and take care of the spiders I'm afraid of?' Exterminators deal with plenty of other kinds of pests, and most retail workers have other responsibilities as well. The difference is most people would find it unreasonable for an exterminator to not do their job due to some fear, why is it suddenly reasonable to have someone else do their job when it comes to fear of heights? newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Oh trust me, almost every woman has thought about this. But why should women be the one to suffer when say a married couple wants to have a child?  newlinechar  newlinechar Why should employers suffer when a woman wants to limit her productivity willingly?  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Are women to be relegated to two groups? One that has a job but no children or another group where they have children but are barred from having a profession? newlinechar  newlinechar Who said anything about being barred from a profession? The point is there is only so much time in the day, and every hour you spend on one means an hour you can't spend on the other. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Also these days if you want to provide for your children both parents have to work. There isn't enough disposable income for one parent to not be in the labor force. newlinechar  newlinechar Unfortunately, that didn't really become a necessity until women flooded the workforce and by virtue of having more workers, wages went down; supply and demand is a harsh mistress. I'm not blaming women for it, but even if we instead an influx of 100 million workers a similar effect would have happened. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;You seem to be focusing on different issues and seem to be forcing the 'blame' of pregnancy on women newlinechar  newlinechar This seems like a mischaracterization of what I'm saying. Women *choose* to have their pregnancies. They *choose* to work less when they start a family. The fact employers want employees to be productive-which the easiest way to do so is work more-isn't 'blaming' women for pregnancy, it's holding them accountable for their choices.

Of course, that was the point of the original post. My point is that many who say they can't attend need to look critically at their lives and re-evaluate their priorities. They may find that they are simply unwilling to risk losing their relatively secure position in the world. Can't is an absolute term. Very, very few people actually *can't* attend. They are making a choice that what they would have to sacrifice to attend is more valuable than the movement. Virtually everyone who attends sacrifices *something*. Sometimes, those things really aren't worth sacrificing. I wouldn't quit my job in order to attend. I wouldn't deliberately get arrested if I had children to support. Everyone has to make these decisions for themselves.     newlinechar  newlinechar My main point is that the difference in actually attending and pressing the 'like button' is VAST. Someone who shares a link on facebook or up-votes a post on reddit and feels satisfied that they did all they could is very likely deluding themselves. Those people who really make an immense effort to publicize the movement and openly discuss it with critics are commendable, but we should make the distinction before glorifying armchair activists and contributing to their contentment. **TL;DR The iceberg should be mostly above water.**

On the contrary, I think it speaks volumes about what Harrison Ford contributed to the role.

When it's hard to entertain any other possibility, it could be an indication of just how well the role was done in the first place.

Yeah, one of my friends built a hairspray powered cannon for a science class combustion project. He could launch a tennis ball about 200 yards with it.

There's been a couple of studies recently that have shown that the rate of homelessness in American cities doesn't have much to do with undersupply of mental health care, but instead correlates most strongly with the cost of rent of the lowest-quality housing. The cheaper it is to get into an apartment, the lower the rate of homelessness is. newlinechar  newlinechar Incidentally, many of the comorbidities associated with homelessness (depression, anxiety, drug abuse, alcohol abuse) tend to fade when housing is provided. Providing unsheltered people with housing (duh) is the only decent way to treat homelessness in the short term. Working *damn hard* to lower rents is the way to do it in the long term.

Republicans and Satanists are polar opposites in the social realm. Your use of the adjective 'classical' is what throws me off most as well as the rampant 'thesaurus' overwriting. (I doubt you used a thesaurus. I'm just saying it's overwritten, and that's the diagnosis any English professor would give you on that sentence.) The use of the word 'classical' in this context would be encompassing liberal as a total ideology -- not just the social aspect. I think you should have used the word 'socially' twice if that's what you mean, as it would clarify your comparison.

Probably has to do with the fact that skill levels in Brood War were much more stratified. SCBW had a lot of market penetration, but in my opinion, much of the popular draw had to do with the fact that players were able to take so few units and defeat much larger armies thanks to the much deeper and better micro system that made the game so impressive.   newlinechar  newlinechar It's almost impossible to win at a large enough supply disadvantage in SC2. It's mostly to do with the AI and somewhat to do with the simplified control and less-interesting spells. Either way, the game just seems like a weighted coin toss at the top levels. newlinechar  newlinechar It disturbs me deeply to keep seeing new faces at the top.

You need to know that this has absolutely nothing to do with your allergy.

It was corrosive to my parents' relationship, and I am telling you the topic of this dissatisfaction was always different, but the underlying tone was the same: my grandmother didn't like my mom.   newlinechar  newlinechar This may be a hard thing to grasp, but for your health (in terms of how you think about your allergy) and the health of your relationship with your SO, you need to have some serious conversations about this.

Hello, historian IRL here. First of all, Hitler remained a Catholic til his death. Second of all, Stalin trained to be a priest in his teenage years and all the other bolsheviks considered him to be by far the most religious of any of them. if you go back and watch his speeches, they are EXACTLY in the style of Russian-orthodox services, what which his deliberate low, soothing voice, repitition, chanting etc.  newlinechar  newlinechar OK, now, lets get going. First of all, the idea that communism has been responsible for most of the massacres is nonsense. In fact, even in countries like Russia and China, *capitalism* has been responsible for far more deaths. We  all know about the mistake of the great leap forward, which killed perhaps 20 million. But, as Amartya Sen has pointed out, in a paper which won him the Nobel Prize, Mao's healthcare reforms have probably saved the lives of 250 million Chinese people since they were installed. In it, he compares India to China. They are both huge Asian countries with massive populations and resources who freed themselves from imperialism in the 1940s. The first half of the book deals with China. Sem concludes that Mao's great leap forward was an ideological mistake which cost the lives of perhaps 20 million people. No doubt about that. You have to remember though, that if you weild power in China, every decision you make will kill or save millions of people. You have to remember though, that if you weild power in China, every decision you make will kill or save millions of people. I once sneezed in Beijing and killed like 500k people. He also praises Mao for instituting health reforms which saw millions of doctors trained. Have you seen those [Hans Rosling videos](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbkSRLYSojo) Look at 3:00. Look at the massive jump China makes in Mao's time. Just think about what that means; pushing a billion people's life expectancy up by 25 years in 20 years. That, for me as a historian and utilitarian, is the greatest achievement in human history. newlinechar  newlinechar However, free-market capitalist India ideologically decided that the market would take care of health. As a result, Sem concludes that during the period of China's great leap forward (20 million died) India's political/ideolical decision to not implement health reform cost the lives of 100-150 million people from disease, illness etc. Even now, as China's life expectancy has shot up, child mortality in India is almost as bad as it was 80 years ago. Indians' quality of life index is lower even than Bangladeshis'. Most people consider Mao's China the depths of human history, but as Sem has pointed out, the worst period of Chinese history is only slightly worse than the best years of Indian history. The question that arises is if we abhor Maosim what should we think of free-market capitalism? newlinechar  newlinechar but Mao's 20 million is but a drop in the ocean compared to capitalist attrocities- attrocities which you need to have a PHD in history to even know about. Britain, for instance, fought China in the [opium wars](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opium_Wars). Britain smuggled in an average of 2.5 million kg of opium per year into China over a period of a century. During the 1880s, there was a yearly average of 6.5 million kg of opium coming into China. How much can one smackhead use in a year? Surely no more than one kilo. So just do the maths- 2-3 million heavy duty smackheads per year for a century. I think a conservative estimate for the death toll is 100 million.  newlinechar  newlinechar [David Stannard](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qra6pcn4AOE) has shown that the ethnic cleansing of Indians in North America resulted in the deaths of 80 million people.  newlinechar  newlinechar Or what about Spain's crimes? perhaps 50 million people were wiped out in the Americas, never to return. newlinechar  newlinechar Or Belgium, where in the Congo, it is estimated that 8 million were murdered or worked to death. newlinechar  newlinechar Or the transatlantic slave trade. newlinechar  newlinechar Or how about this: hands up how many people knew that Britain, in 1943, [killed more Bengalis (not Indians, but just in one province of India) than Hitler killed Jews in the same year.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bengal_famine_of_1943) newlinechar  newlinechar And what about the British conquest of India, the greatest crime in human history. The popular story is that the British helped modernize India. The British were annoyed to find that, in a study in 1883, they found that in the two millenia before British rule, the Indian subcontinent had suffered only 17 serious famines. [Under 130 years of British rule, it had suffered 31.](http://www.reddit.com/r/lectures/comments/osep7/feeding_ten_billion_the_world_just_got_its_seven/) Since independence, there has been no famines whatsoever. It is really difficult to put a number on it but we're looking at 200-400 million deaths because of British rule. And who even knows this? newlinechar  newlinechar What I've been trying to prove to you is that states are by their very nature, violent, but capitalist states are orders of magnitude more violent than communist states. (how many countries has china invaded, ever? ok, got a number? how many has the US invaded in your lifetime?) Therefore, it is unbelieveable hypocritical to judge other states by their faults when we live in others which have committed incomprehensively greater ones. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar

If you are using a normal knife:  Sap, wait for engy to try to take off the sapper, stab him while he's turned around.  This is best done when all sentries have sappers on them.

(where ????? is the address of the lives), then you'd just basically fuck up the game. Most likely, you'd jump into the middle of code that made no sense given the context of the other game, leading to a crash.  newlinechar  newlinechar That said, in the theoretical environment of a TAS, it has been demonstrated that save corruption (i.e. resetting while saving) can actually lead to crazy, beneficial results.

&gt; They've recreated DNA in a laboratory out of non-organic materials (aka, it's falsifiable) newlinechar  newlinechar Abiogenesis seeks to explain the origin of life on earth. The ability to create certain materials in a lab is interesting, but as 'origin of life', it's not falsifiable. It has interesting implications for our understanding of early evolution, but it's not on the same level. This is exactly how I see evolutionary psychology. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; I can list many, many more if you'd like. newlinechar  newlinechar You can't, and you know it. Also, I asked for MORE promiscuous females. Providing the oddball species where everybody fucks everybody else's brains out isn't a good example. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; In some tribes of Sierra Leone (where some speculate humans originated), promiscuity is a privilege of female nobility. newlinechar  newlinechar [citation needed] newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Tibeten, Southern Indian, and Nepalese women also practice polyandry where the woman has multiple husbands newlinechar  newlinechar This has nothing to do with promiscuity. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; And even presently, men are no more promiscuous than women in western countries. newlinechar  newlinechar Wow, a study measuring promiscuity by number of offspring. I can't think of a worse way to measure it. Their method of AVERAGING number of offspring across men and women, and comparing the average can't even disprove what they claim to set out to: 'the belief that some men are incredibly successful at mating while others fail altogether. ' (it's hard to tell what the method actually was from such a shitty article though). newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; In India the skin on woman's lower back is more erotic than the breasts.

I'm not talking about the homeless population that relates to those studies.  I am talking about chronic, serious mental illness that results in chronic homelessness. I am talking about my patients, who *can't* pay rent, because they can't keep their shit together.  When they are housed, they can't stay housed.  When they are getting treatment, the treatment lapses.   newlinechar  newlinechar Once these people were kept in hospitals.  The hospitals provided them with activities, basic trades (like wood working, chair making, etc.) allowed for them to have a place to live while getting regular treatment.  Regan took this system down, and we have never seen anything other than the poorly funded community mental health system pick up the slack. newlinechar  newlinechar Yeah, the rent is too fucking high, especially here.

Just from reading 2x there are hundreds of anecdotes of women saying, 'He just was so persistent/demanding/moved so fast, I didn't know how to tell him I didn't want to, he just seemed to expect it,' that I really feel this HAS been a failing of society to teach.

I often feel that maybe many of these people are just going through the motions because it is expected of them and they do not think they can say no. newlinechar  newlinechar I think women need to be educated on the same fact, often times they don't realize that they CAN say no in any situation and that they don't OWE anyone anything (regardless of how much dinner/the jewelry/the &lt;expensive gift here&gt; cost). newlinechar  newlinechar

It's not like that. Without a government and some sort of police force, people would run amuck, killing, stealing, and generally doing how they please. Now, it may not be as dramatic a picture as I paint, but I am sure it would be much worse. newlinechar  newlinechar Most people want security. In order to have security, we inherently have to give up some of our freedoms. For example, in order for us to not be killed, we cannot kill. In order for us not to be stolen from, we can't steal. So some of our freedoms are taken away and security is gained. newlinechar  newlinechar Do these things still happen? Of course. But consequences and a police force will deter many potential crimes that would happen in the absence of one. newlinechar  newlinechar You want your 'freedom back'? What freedom. The freedom to kill? To steal? What exactly is it you're looking for? I admit that some laws are ridiculous, and if it's too much for you to take, move to another country or get involved in politics and try to make a change. We have the freedom to leave this country if we aren't pleased. The control of the military is ultimately in the hands of the civilians since we finance it.

I agree with that to a certain extent. I have two kits, one Pearl Prestige Session that I have as a 1/2 up, 1 down with hats, dream paper thin 20', 21' vintage ride and a hhx china. Then I have my first 'good' kit, a pdp cx that is 8', 10', 12', 14', 16', 22'. I find that with sizes of kits, it's all about what kind of music you are practicing with.

I doubt it'd help him if he downsized, but this is a pretty extreme example.  newlinechar  newlinechar A great thing though that you will find with a smaller set-up if you are downsizing, it will help your playing and improvisation.

You have to understand the perverse worldview that a slaveholder lives in. newlinechar  newlinechar At the primary level you have the fundamental idea that somehow slavery is right, that either it isn't fundamentally a wrong against the slave or that the slave somehow deserves or needs it. newlinechar  newlinechar Now factor in a lifetime of experience in that environment. You are going to see slaves in a certain light. To you it will appear as though the only worthwhile work they do comes as the product of their slavery, while they seemingly waste their free time. Not to mention the problems of their lack of education which you might construe as also a lack of intelligence. newlinechar  newlinechar Now consider the way a master and slave would interact. When a master asks his slave a question how likely is it that the slave would answer truthfully? What is a slave going to say when his master asks whether he enjoys being a slave, or enjoys working on the plantation. At best they're going to make some non-committal response, at worst they're going to outright lie to avoid a confrontation. The chances they are going to say they hate it is very low. newlinechar  newlinechar Some slave owners may not have the mental acuity to appreciate such things, they may imagine that working on a plantation for their former owners is a perfectly good and enjoyable thing for a former slave to do.

Thats an interesting question, and one I've actually thought about before. Now, and I may be wrong here, but in my experience of dealing with deaf people, the ones who have grown up with a deaf family and had a good home experience actually have good relationships with hearing people. Like I know more than one deaf person, who as a child was beaten and abused emotionally because of the fact that he or she could not hear and do things like everyone else could. It's these people, when they discover the deaf community, cling on to it with all they can because it almost fills a hole that was made by childhood trauma. It can cause pride to the extent that you wouldn't give your child a CI. (Cochlear implant) However, in my father's family, half of my cousins are hearing, and half are deaf. None of my deaf cousins have gotten CI's or anything of the sort. One or two of my cousins may have worn a hearing aid for a while like 7 years ago, but not important. It's the same reason why any hearing parent would want to give a CI to their deaf child. Parents want to share a first language with their children. Sorry for the long response lol

In regards to the jobs where being pregnant hinders someone's ability to perform the tasks that she was hired for, then I am all for them being laid off.

I think looking forward this early will cause you to 'honeymoonize' things and maybe rush things once you're in a relationship with someone because you already have it ingrained in your mind that you're comfortable with marrying early. I'm not saying it's bad, back then in the USA the average marrying age was early 20s and my parents married at 25/27, respectively, but you're just committing too much to someone at an age where neither of you can support yourself on your own yet fully and independently (I'm going to love my parents until one of us dies first, they're amazing). I don't have a problem with other people getting married whenever, but if I'm getting married at 26 or an age that young, I have to wake up every day for at least a few years reinforcing the belief that out of all of the billions of women out there, she and she alone can make me happy and that I trust her enough to feel the same. Currently in high school I haven't been in a relationship in quite a while, so I'm wary of trusting anyone into my comfort zone because they might just walk over me and my heart.

I don't know if that's fair to say. The Islamic Golden Age had a huge impact on modern Western society while European powers were still developing. The combination of anti-Islamic Christian forces (Byzantines and Crusades) and the Mongols put an end to all that. Then the Ottomans eventually came along and built up a new caliphate. Once that collapsed, there was a massive power vacuum in the Middle East that the European powers took advantage of. They're not really separate civilizations, even if they like to think they are. They've always been linked.

That's awesome. Although I have never had a disc returned (and I have lost many), I can comment on the other side of this. I returned my first disc today. I found it last night, called the guy, and returned it at the front office of the course I play at (and snuck in a quick round before class). One thing that stuck with me is the gratitude of the guy when I called him. He had never had a returned disc before this and was so thankful.

Those are my personal grows in those links. Those came from four years of horticultural science, half of which was stuff taught in basic high school biology, so it was unnecessarily repeated. newlinechar  newlinechar There's nothing truly special or different about cannabis cultivation. There are thousands of other plant species across the globe that grow exactly the same way with the difference being cannabis has a photoperiod, whereas (for example) tomatoes and peppers will flower and bear fruit even under long periods of light, despite the nearly identical nutrient requirements at the same stages.

if you want democracy - which means rule by the people - you have to eliminate systems of 'representative government' and make society actually be run DIRECTLY by the people. newlinechar  newlinechar that is the only way to achieve actual democracy.  'representative democracy,' 'constitutional republics' - these have always, and will always, end in tyranny by the few against the many.    money rules Congress.  it does today, it did a century ago, and it ran the Roman Senate.  this will never change. newlinechar  newlinechar some people think that having power in the hands of the people means 'direct democracy.'  no, it means abolishing the use of force, and looking at the economy as what it actually is - a way to allocate resources.  we need to stop letting the richest people dictate the functioning of society, and seize power back from them.  that means abolishing government and radically overhauling the way we look at property rights.

Hmmm newlinechar  newlinechar But you're not entitled to be in a relationship with your SO, either.  Doesn't your SO have the right to decide under what circumstances they'll be in a relationship with you?   newlinechar  newlinechar If you consent to sex with your partner because you worry s/he'll leave you if you don't satisfy them, can you really say that your partner is guilty of raping you?  Your partner can break up with you for any reason they wish, after all.  Unless you think that someone should be forced to maintain a relationship lest it cause 'psychological harm' to their partner.  Which I don't think you believe. newlinechar  newlinechar I think sex can be negotiated within a relationship.  If one person says: 'I have a high libido and must have sex at least twice a week in order to be happy,' I don't think this unduly coerces their partner to do anything.  That person's partner can either accept the terms of the relationship, or they are free to find another relationship elsewhere.  I don't believe relationships should be compulsory, or that someone should just accept a sex life that doesn't fulfill their needs. newlinechar  newlinechar If you aren't happy with your sex life, I think you should be free to find a partner who's a better match.

How long of a timeframe do you plan on using to calculate that value - all trades in the last week, 5 days, 3 days, or etc?  newlinechar  newlinechar Also, I would suggest some kind of random sampling or some method to filter out fake trades. Otherwise, someone could do like 100 trades between their main and alt of earbuds for a scrap to drive down the price. Maybe sample x number of trades from each hour of whatever range you use. newlinechar  newlinechar In any case, however you do it, if you can pull off the spreadsheet/database idea that would be as valuable to the community as the trade tracking.

With respect to Nickleback, you've really never seen [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qs4tNeGyTyI)? It's two of their songs played simultaneously, the intention is to demonstrate they recycle their music.

&gt;How to Pendlay Row. Well, the best way to do them is to start with the bar on the floor every single rep. Your middle back will have slight bend to it. You pull the bar off the floor quickly with the arms, and by a powerful arch of your middle back. You finish by touching the bar to your upper stomach or middle stomach. At no time is there any movement of the hips or knees, no hip extension at all, all that bends is the middle back and the shoulders and elbows. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar [Quote from Strongiifts](http://stronglifts.com/how-to-perform-the-pendlay-row-with-correct-technique/) newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar The Pendlay Row should involve arching your back, which would raise your chest an inch or two.

Well guess what, a small number of people voting on lots of things they like does not help them outvote a million people. Another reason I have heard was that we would have swept the little category because all of us vote on stuff. So? Isn't this whole contest about the 'best' community, however the voters chose to define best?  newlinechar  newlinechar I would also argue that the fact they separated the little and large communities was that they were aware of the fact that lots of people who like their favorite subreddit would vote for it, so they made another category that would have less of a raw numbers effect.

You should never close a property without title insurance.   newlinechar  newlinechar Title insurance doesn't specifically protect you from costs/taxes/etc.  Title  insurers will pull all debts and liens and make sure they're satisfied at close.  They also ensure that the provisions of the purchase and sale agreement (PSA) are implemented.  Generally prior taxes are the responsibility of the Seller.  However, that's because that's generally what's specified in the PSA along with proration of current year's taxes through the date of close. newlinechar  newlinechar You should never close a property without title insurance.   newlinechar  newlinechar Title insurance ensures that the seller has the right to sell you the property and that as mentioned above that what the seller is transferring to you is in fact clear title. newlinechar  newlinechar By the way, you should never close a property without title insurance.

Context: Washington state (I know this story is Kansas) newlinechar  newlinechar Min wage is 9.07 an hour (closer to 11.00 when you count the payroll taxes employers have to pay, and there is no alternate min wage for tipped jobs) newlinechar  newlinechar If a driver can deliver three deliveries an hour that means it costs about 3.66 in labor added just for the delivery, plus mileage (either in a per mile or per delivery basis).  The delivery fee that a place will charge goes to recoup the costs of keeping that driver on staff, otherwise they wouldn't have a job. newlinechar  newlinechar Also, drivers don't sit around doing nothing in between deliveries.  Like stated elsewhere, they are integral in the operation of the restaurant.  A 350.00 order most likely was several trips back and forth from the car, and if the driver is worth have a shit they most likely set up the different pizzas in piles according to toppings, laid out napkin, plates, sodas, sides, etc.  I agree that tipping 10,15,20% doesn't always make sense for delivery as a rule, but 5.00 on 350.00 is a douche move.   newlinechar  newlinechar Also big orders like that, the tip is usually split with the kitchen crew.

I'd suggest looking through the board guide to the right. newlinechar  newlinechar If it's TL;DR, look for any dropped platform board. They handle great on hills, and are nice and low for easy cruising. The Earthwing Supermodel is a nice cheap one, that everybody loves, same with the Earthwing Roadkiller.

Recoil is not completely random see [here](http://symthic.com/?s=bf3&amp;sb=dmgchart) newlinechar  newlinechar What you are talking about is random bullet deviation/spread, e.g. you aim on a player, but the bullet kind of goes 'sideways' out of your gun so it misses them. newlinechar  newlinechar What you're saying is correct because with zero *recoil* bullets will still spread around the target if you are spraying at them, but the interesting question is whether [recoil + random spread] is better than [0 recoil + random spread]. My guess is that there probably isn't that much difference. newlinechar  newlinechar This is what makes me think that he just has bad aim. Why would someone use this if its effects are minimal at range? Check out his long range shots, he still full auto sprays, but why? If the macro is there it isn't helping him!
Don't know why you're getting downvoted... actually nevermind, I do know why. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Some retards on reddit think America/Israel making serious threats of bombing a country back to the stone age isn't an act of aggression, rather an act of defense by citing a misinterpretation of Ahmadinejad's statements regarding the Israeli regime being illegitimate. But instead these bleating sheep fall victim to the propagandists who say the Iranians are advocating genocide. Watch the downvotes. newlinechar  newlinechar While it's true that the fundamentalist Islamic regime of Iran is not compatible with many western values, using one mistranslation as a pretext for ~~offensive~~ er...'defensive' action is fucking ridiculous.

When that makes absolutely no fucking sense. 
That's simply not true. A $10 order is probably going to be a pretty simple delivery. A $300 order is likely going to a place that's more complicated to deliver too, and will take multiple trips to drop off.  I can't think of anyone who can carry over twenty pizzas at once. newlinechar  newlinechar EDIT: To clarify this point.  A $10 order will likely just being going to a house or apartment.  A $300 order is almost definitely going to a particular place in a hotel, business, or academic building. Moreover, if they're the sort that's going to give that small a tip on that large an order, they're probably also not going to be considerate enough to give an accurate description of how to get to the particular place they want their food taken too. By multiple trips I mean too and from your car, I can't imagine an order would be large enough that it'd require multiple trips too and from the store without an extra special situation.
Personally I haven't experienced it. My friend and I were having a discussion about this earlier today. He goes on to tell me that the Arabs at our local mosque tend to stay away from him in prayer. My friend is a large African American male and I suppose that's what scares them. He has converted from Christianity, maybe that also plays a last in their view of him. I can't fathom why the umma here is that bad. We are all brothers and should treat each other as equals. It's a disappointment.

Yes, but... stock options are often mandated in contracts or performance-related or in some way guaranteed or expected, right? Over here it would be illegal to pay someone less than minimum wage even if they get tips - because what if one month you don't get enough tips? It seems silly to put a social obligation on people to make up part of the wages... when I order a pizza here, it costs more, and the person delivering it gets a fair wage.

&gt; I think people like to live away from the crowds. They like to live in a place where there is order and calm, and there is an absence of commerce. (the proverbial 'bedroom community'). The city cannot be that place. newlinechar  newlinechar People pay orders of magnitude more per square unit of floor space to live in the city than in the suburbs. To the degree that it's possible to measure people's preferences by how they choose to spend their money, it's clear that they overwhelmingly prefer to live in cities. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; There is something that pushes people OUT of the city. The noise, trash, crime, crowds, disorder, or some combination (I'm guessing. Really I'm just projecting my own preferences on the entire world). It's no good forcing people to live in a place. A better approach is to attract the people to live there. Find out what makes them run away, and fix it. Fix the crime, fix the noise, or whatever it is. newlinechar  newlinechar The real problem is that cities have been spoiled by altering them to fit the needs of people who live in the suburbs. If cities in American were really built around the needs of city dwellers (no cars, comprehensive public transportation, mixed-use zoning, green space) then they wouldn't be the alienating places that fall into blight and disrepair. Instead, they have to have highways and parking for the commuters. newlinechar  newlinechar — Sincerely, someone who moved (via a long, convoluted path) from an American city of wide boulevards and ample parking to a European city of twisty little streets and shops on every corner and is amazed daily by the qualitative improvement of experience in nearly every possible way.

I don't know if sociologists have a solid answer for this, but it's something I've been curious about as well. One of the reasons groups like Asians/Iranians have assimilated more effectively is because their culture emphasizes a lot of the same values. I feel like ghetto culture may have evolved partly as an attempt to 'distance' themselves from 'white culture,' which if true is a damn shame because in the end it just reinforces inequality because of the glorification of ignorance that you're talking about.

You get a downvote for douchebaggery. A former delivery driver, that's against tipping delivery drivers as a rule? You know firsthand the nonsense that they put up with. As was posted above, they mosttimes work inhouse, taking orders, cleaning floors, making pizzas... And for less than minimum wage almost always. They depend on your tip to pay their bills, but you, like many others.. have an obscene sense of self-righteousness and feel that it's somehow ok to waste their time, when they could be out delivering food to someone not completely ignorant. Just remember, they DO know where you live, and they DO remember you. Wondering why your pizza tastes like ball sweat this time? Stop wondering, it's MY ball sweat. Enjoy prick.

Yeah, re-fluffing is almost a daily necessity with those things. If it's fairly dry, you can pull out the stuffing, squeeze it with a paper towel to dry it further, and roll the stuffing between your fingers.

Otherwise, just use a toothpick to pull out (just a bit) the stuffing about 1/4', and use the toothpick as a comb to re-fluff.

Well, the poster shows a young woman wearing a short skirt, apparently passed out drunk, flopped across a couch with her bra strap showing.  Ostensibly, it's aimed at men, but you would have to be pretty dense not to pick up a related message: passed out women are at risk for rape.

Can you explain what you mean? newlinechar  newlinechar Do you mean: '*have sex with me or I'll beat you?*'  Because that's undeniably rape. newlinechar  newlinechar Or do you mean: '*have sex with me or I'll yell at you*?'  That's more of a grey area.  If the emotional abuse is severe, then I don't have a problem calling that coercion.

Recoil is random, but limited by the gun. When it says it goes .4 left, .4 right that doesn't mean it will always go .4 to the left and then .4 to the right and alternate back and forth. It just means that it will be somewhere randomly in-between. newlinechar  newlinechar I just did some testing myself and confirmed that both recoil and spread is random. The bigger thing I noticed is that spread is much more of a problem than recoil. If I just pull down slightly I can keep my crosshair in a fairly small circle, but the bullets will hit in a much larger circle, due to the spread. newlinechar  newlinechar After watching more videos of this shaking and testing things myself, I still believe my first post to be accurate.

Anonymity, unless the user wants to protect their work. Pseudonyms could also work in that case as well, but the person would have to break their pseudonym, but there may be ways to protect yourself in that case. newlinechar  newlinechar I think to ensure the freedom of the internet, anonymity is a requirement, with the ability to use pseudonym if a user so desires.There should be very few cases where your real information is required, such as banking etc. newlinechar  newlinechar Missed part of your question in my first answer. Well to address copyright disputes there are two solutions. First, create services that reduce the desire to 'pirate.' Second, make it obvious what sort of protection you have on your work and then make access easy for another user to license. If some one takes your photo and puts it on a website, while being anonymous, then the owner of the website should be obligated to take it down, *provided you can prove that it is yours.* If you cannot, then you should not be able to take down the image. newlinechar  newlinechar How do we deal with repeat offenders? I think that should be up to the individual websites, and may be based off of the imperfect IP addressing. Again, everything must be proven beforehand and now afterwards.

&gt;Some woman says 'Thank God that the doctors cured your cancer!' and some guy takes a screenshot of him saying 'Screw your God! The doctors did all the work without him!' (Real post). newlinechar  newlinechar I know exactly what you mean, I think those posts are really obnoxious too. However, the post I'm referring to implies that doctors and scientists find cures because of prayer, not research. He pretty much spells it out like that. I'm not challenging you, I am completely disagreeing with you.
Nice cage. Here's a few suggestions. newlinechar  newlinechar You should cover the wire levels. As another poster said, they can get bumblefoot from plain wire. Fleece is nice-- I think it gets smelly really fast. I don't have wire shelves, so I can't give you much advice there. Maybe some coroplast. newlinechar  newlinechar For toys... Don't waste your money. :) Most rats will love and even play more with something as simple as a paper bag. I put in towel tubes, paper bags, wrapping paper after Christmas/birthdays. Anything crinkly. newlinechar  newlinechar A big suggestion, rather than shoving the cage full of toys, is to invest in a wheel. The large silent spinner wheels are the best. If you get one of these, they're a bit more stable if you hook the back to the cage and use the stand that comes with them. It would fit nicely on the bottom level, more than likely, if you removed the water bottle from the left side. It would be safer there than placed on the second level in case they go crazy with it. Wodent wheels are also high rated, but I've never owned one. newlinechar  newlinechar With the food and water. The water bottle should be glass. Since it's on the outside it doesn't make TOO much of a difference, though. Rats love to chew, and if they get bored that would be something they may be able to reach their noses through and gnaw on. Plastic is also porous-- so after a few months you may have a smell coming from the cage and you're not going to know where the heck it's coming from. It'll be the water bottle. lol. In addition here, I'd keep the food and water closer together. It doesn't really matter, but that second level would be a nice place. I would definitely invest in a LARGE glass bottle as well as a ceramic food dish. My two girls drink a lot of water-- as in I would have to fill your water bottle at least once daily. I keep a large one (the next size up from that one) and the regular one hooked to my cage in case (yes, honestly) I don't pay attention for a few days or just get too lazy.  newlinechar  newlinechar You don't really need all the igloos you have added as well as the pouch. Not like they do any harm to have in, though. Rats usually cuddle up and sometimes won't even use an igloo. My girls like to turn it over like a bowl and sleep in it together. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Some questions about what you're going to use... Do you have a food picked out? I use Kaytee Forti-diet and love it. They get fresh veggies occasionally, too. What bedding were you planning on? I use a recycled paper bedding called Back2Nature. It's nice, low on dust, and very odor absorbent. I wouldn't suggest carefresh or yesterdays news, and cedar and pine wood shavings should be avoided.

&gt; If I input diameter 2, the output should be 33.5103, but it is printing out 4.18879..... for me, which is only multiplying (4.0 / 3.0) * PI newlinechar  newlinechar No, that is correct, because a diameter of 2 means a radius of 1, and 1^3 is still 1, so the result is 4pi/3. Try putting in a diameter of 4, then you'll see your 33.5103.

Obvious hyperbole? But that's essentially the premise. Don't live your daily life because there's a tiny chance that a sex offender might rape you. Like every other day.
And that is true too. So what you have to do is not buy your groceries from the supermarket. You don't know where the vegetables have been or what's been on them, you don't know what hormones and antibiotics and poisons have been shoved into the meat or fish. The best you can do is minimise the amount of crap they shove in the food you eat. The closer to the start of the food chain, the better you will be. You can raise your own vegetables, or buy from farmers markets and hope they really did grow that stuff and it is DDT free. And you can raise and slaughter your own animals, like I have done, or you again go to farmer's markets and buy from them, or you form a relationship with those little specialist farmers and you buy a cow or a stake in a cow or a pig, and they raise them and then slaughter them and you pay for the privilege. If you do it yourself, you know what's in it. If you don't, there's gonna be crap in it, and it's your choice how much crap is in it.

My problem with Arrival is twofold. newlinechar  newlinechar 1. the story is awful. The agent could have stopped Shepard from doing anything to stop the Reapers at like 15 separate points in the story. It would be as simple as 'The reapers will be here in two days, wait - I mean two years, just go on your way and come back in a week or two.' Instead of trying to indoctrinate him. newlinechar  newlinechar 2. The action was okay (even if the reasoning for going alone was paper thin) but compared to the two previous DLCs (Shadow Broker and Overlord) it wasn't anything special.

So that justifies hating people who don't eat them? I understand that some vegans are annoying and judgmental. However, as a vegan who NEVER tries to push veganism on others, I can say that much of what people perceive as judgement from vegans could be their own discomfort with the issue and internal guilt. I don't even tell people I'm vegan and simply live my life as I choose. But, when people find out I am vegan either while eating together or because someone else mentions it, a good majority of them immediately begin defending their right to eat meat and many have even insulted me when the only thing I have done is choose not to eat something they like.  newlinechar  newlinechar And I assure you, I do not fall into the category of self-righteous vegans and I do not have any illusion that humans are meant to be vegan. I simply refuse to give any of my money to the meat and dairy industries of the U.S. because they are disgusting.  newlinechar  newlinechar As annoying and judgement as some vegans are, it has been my experience that meat eaters are many times more offensive in their judgment and remarks to vegans and vegetarians.

This reminds me of some of my grandpa's stories. He was stationed in Okinawa in the 50s and he and his buddies were always getting drunk and causing trouble.

My grandpa was 6'5' and a former collegiate football player, so they couldn't exactly forcibly remove him. He was too drunk to find the exit, so instead he just tore through one of their paper walls and walked out.

But the ways Freud describes its affect on us and the degree to which it does so is what's most profound. newlinechar  newlinechar Overall, my opinion is that psychoanalysis by no means explains everything (and that shouldn't be one's goal), but I feel it makes quite a bit more sense than a lot of other ways of understanding ourselves.  newlinechar  newlinechar I mean, the guy has made some pretty sound arguments.

And even with the duopoly, there's still plenty of innovation going on with each major release, and from forks like CyanogenMod. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;It has exacerbated the worst tendencies in device manufacturers, such as piling features in with no respect for how it actually changes the device's operation and dragging their feet when it comes to updates. Basically, not thinking at all of what the customer will do with their phone after they buy it. As a result there is no Android phone worth buying. newlinechar  newlinechar Manufacturers suck, but they were like that before Android and they'll always be like that no matter what the OS. It's kind of a double-edged sword of FOSS that manufacturers can do almost whatever they want with it, including locking the hardware. Thankfully, there are some devices out there that are fully open, like the Nexus and Geeksphone lines, as well as at least one other really nifty phone that plugs into a tablet thing that I've completely forgotten the name of.
This is all common. You should talk to your MD though. S/he can refer you to a psych. Just be careful how they try to medicate you, and they will.
I do it because the first recipe I found said to do it. I think the first time I did a roast it was in the oven so you brown the meat to help keep the juices in. AFAIK it doesn't hurt the quality of the roast in the crockpot. It could also be that it helps to kill off anything living on the surface of the meat because crockpots can take a while to bring it out of the 'Danger Zone' or above 140. I don't know for sure why I do it. It is just the way I learned. There is more than one way to skin a cat.

I have a great group of friends and girlfriend but tend to be a loner in a lot of situations.

Well, I'd been writing for other artists and was feeling limited in my creativity, so when I wrote DRNK TXTNG, I just kinda went from there. I wanted to write songs that were personal to me, but others could relate to. That's honestly been my philosophy since I started writing, but when you write for other artists, sometimes that feeling gets lost in translation.  newlinechar  newlinechar Also, the main 'inspiration' was basically what I was going through around that time. DRNK TXTNG was the first song on the album, and the rest of the songs kinda deal with the 'aftermath' of that whole experience.

But if you were to recover (be at death's door, and come back) would you claim a faith? I would be skeptical even if I did pray for salvation, I would be thinking alongside that prayer that 'this is ridiculous, there is no afterlife' but I won't know til I'm on my deathbed, and if I did die - who would care? If there is a god and a heaven, and I prayed for salvation moments before my last breath, I'd find out after I died, and if I was right through my life of not believing in an afterlife regardless of my last breath's uncertainty and there is none - I'd just be dead - no longer thinking or being at all (which to me is comforting. I like to think that there is no afterlife, it makes life worth living)
The case may be different for a 15 year old, but if you break someone's arm and get sued or charged for assault or whatever and it is made known that you practice in a martial art that teaches you to break people's arms, I'm pretty sure you get in more trouble than someone without training. I believe your hands are legally considered deadly weapons  in that case, or at least that's what a fellow martial artist told me.

I still like it in this case, because it fits the story (Indy fails) and the some of the superobjectives of the movie (good triumphs, God is real) still play out well. newlinechar  newlinechar Also in *The Departed*, an even better movie. Don't want to spoil the ending, but it is very deus ex machina, but it fits the theme of the movie in the way it is done.

Several problems here. newlinechar  newlinechar Firstly, 'everyone knows..' is nonsense. There is a lot of disagreement - that's what controversy is, and r/atheism is nothing if not controversial.  newlinechar  newlinechar Secondly, 'bashing' is a very crude term for what is more a blend of criticism, lamentation, satire, exasperation and mockery. It's not all nice, but we are under no obligation to be nice, especially considering the nature of the type of ideology we are pushing back against. If we were just being nice we would have no effect at all. And obviously we want to have an effect, because these are issues that matter quite a bit. newlinechar  newlinechar Thirdly, the focus on Christianity is simply a symptom of the fact that most redditors are American, and America is utterly saturated by Christianity. It's not like we picked a random religion to pick on. If America was saturated by a different religion, rest assured, that would be represented in the subreddit.  newlinechar  newlinechar And finally, you have completely ignored all of the very positive things that come out of the subreddit - support for secular causes such as church and state issues, support for young atheists who are unable to come out (or those who have come out and have been ostracised by their family and friends, or even kicked out of home), promotion of rationalism, science, etc.  newlinechar  newlinechar 'Just a place to bash religion'. What rubbish.
Let me go over this again.  newlinechar  newlinechar Obama, by his own admission, modeled 'Obamacare' on Romney Care. newlinechar  newlinechar On your second point, if the only choice between Obama and say, a stick, a clock, my dog, a mailbox or a 1/2 blind cat with only two paws, ANYONE but Barack is going to get my vote. newlinechar  newlinechar Romney has already stated he will REPEAL 'Obamacare'. I will hold him to that. newlinechar  newlinechar If Obamacare goes in front of the SCOTUS, 'Romneycare' goes out if they throw out Obamacare. newlinechar  newlinechar Regarding your last point, the stories you are not hearing is from those who have been unemployed here in Massachusetts, who are FORCED to pay insurance or the fine. newlinechar  newlinechar I did the taxes of a man in 2010 for his 2009 taxes who only made $15,000 a year, and the DOR demanded that he pay the fine. COBRA, in Mass, for him would have cost over $1,300 a MONTH After his rent, groceries and auto expenses, he had $11.00 per week left over. newlinechar  newlinechar They didn't care. newlinechar  newlinechar Just so you know, for a family plan, it's $1800+ a month. The maximum you can get on unemployment in Massachusetts is $732.00 a week. Do the math. newlinechar  newlinechar And those who don't want to work, they get free MassCare. Thank you stupid taxpayers. No fine for them! But if you work, you don't qualify. newlinechar  newlinechar The point of my post is there are going to be hundreds of little things that are going to make this program a nightmare, but people just won't listen. newlinechar  newlinechar Good luck to them and all the rest of you who think they know best.

There are more factors at play than just the distance food is shipped. Food grown in a friendly climate (ideal sunlight, soil conditions, humidity, and fauna), then shipped across an ocean on a freighter with tens of thousands of tons of other goods will usually be more sustainable than locally grown foods in a non-native environment. Growing crops out of their natural climates can require frequent watering, pesticides, and fertilizers, which, together, create a less efficient agricultural environment. newlinechar  newlinechar I figure changing people's food consumption to only native crops is something too radical to be adopted.

The closest I came was on a school trip to an amusement park my senior year of high school. Two of the male teachers, who were coaches, went with us and somehow talk me and the 2 female friends I was hanging out with into going to the water park together. Now I had seriously crushed on my algebra 1 and 2 teacher since the first day of 9th grade, and I had the opportunity to see him shirtless in a water park? It was everything I had always fapped of it being--big shoulders, muscles, a thick coat of chest hair, and a little bit of a belly. When his trunks were wet and clinging to his junk, I could pretty well make out what I had always thought about during class. It was great. When we went to the locker room to dry off and get dressed, I managed to see him pulling down his trunks from behind and his ass was glorious. So much fap-material was generated that day.

Really? Do tell. Tell me which classes have a harder time escaping than Fire Mages. newlinechar  newlinechar Freeze moves (CoC and Nova) don't amount to much for Fire because our DoTs break them in 2-3 ticks. This isn't per DoT, this is overall, and Fire Mages are always aiming to have 2-3 DoTs on the target at a time. If they snared you (which they should have), then you don't have enough time to get away if you don't Blink away. If you use Blink as anything except a counter against a melee that hasn't used their gap-closer on you, then you've wasted it. So, you have to slowly move away and have about 2 seconds to do it. newlinechar  newlinechar Blazing Speed is a low-chance proc, so it's not at all reliable. newlinechar  newlinechar Our immobilizing bubble isn't an escape at all. It sticks you in place and, if your Blink is on cooldown, you're basically screwed unless someone is going to help you. Priests will dispel it or Warrior will break it. newlinechar  newlinechar That leaves our our casted stun and our frontal-cone disorienting move as our only reliable escape. However, Dragon's Breath seems to have a less-forgiving frontal cone than CoC does (or possibly farther forward). Whether or not this is true, I find it missing my target a lot more often than CoC does. It's a great move for preemptive strike, but fails often (for me) when used defensively against a melee that's training you. newlinechar  newlinechar In order to play Fire Mage successfully, you have to be able to predict your opponent's moves or get the jump on them. If you get charged or stunned, escaping is very unlikely without assistance.

She should have trained the dragons.  Her dragons are the entire foundation for her power, but she forgot them.

Her problem was, by not looking back, she never knew what she wanted going forward.

You are immediatly told that you 'Listen to Limbaugh' or 'Beck' or 'Watch Fox News'. newlinechar  newlinechar As someone who watches BBC America, MSNBC, and Fox, but doesn't 'listen' to talk radio, I find their accusations to be their way of attacking anyone who doesn't like their opinion. newlinechar  newlinechar I can tell you most of them get their 'facts' from MSNBC, which has to be the most clearly partisan network on TV and calling it journalism. Fox may not be perfect, but they are FAR from being as openly partisan as Chris Matthews, Rachel Maddow, Ed Shultz and Larry O'Donnell. Watch both networks for a while, and you will see my point. newlinechar  newlinechar In short, they are the biggest bunch of hypocrites in politics. They play to the lowest common denominator among voters, such as their stance with OWS.

This is an excellent question - ear soft tissue anatomy leaves nearly zero bony landmarks on the skull, although sometimes we're able to figure out if a fossil organism had bigger ears than close relatives - there is a Miocene dog with very large tympanic bullae, and has been reconstructed like a fennec fox (which has large ears and large bullae). newlinechar  newlinechar If we had no other trunked organisms (Saiga Antelope, Tapirs, Elephant seals, etc.) we would probably have no clue except 'dang, there's something weird going on with that organism's nose'. But, perhaps with knowledge of these other trunked organisms, we could figure out it had some sort of a trunk or proboscis.  newlinechar  newlinechar We do have frozen mammoths, however, with preserved trunks, which is pretty cool.

I get 21.5meg of DSL. At 7:30pm on a Monday (one of the busiest times for internet), I get 14Mbps down and 1Mbps up locally, and about 4-5Mbps to LA. I use a VoIP phone line over it with cheap calling rates- eg: under 10c a minute to a mobile in Thailand, vs about 60-70c with Telecom. The clarity is good. I use about 20GB a month and my bill is under $100, not including toll calls which I rarely make. I can log in online and change call forwarding, my voicemail and settings for it, have WAV copies sent to my email, check my usage and change my data cap almost immediately, and many other features I don't use. newlinechar  newlinechar I'm very happy.

We have a small department, about every two years we divvy up the protocols and update them. Then our medical director reviews and makes changes as needed.   Occasionally, we will add a protocol, usually one crew member will write it and submit it to the medical director for approval.  We also try to keep very current with the latest evidence and will make changes as needed based on new studies.  The most difficult part of all this is keeping current with the latest research for your assigned protocol and providing the latest evidence for *most* of the treatments. Oh, for specialty cases, we get input from the various departments in the local hospital, especially with how they want neuro, pediatric and trauma patients treated.

Sadly, no, that's not how it will work.  All the big Korean sponsors that want a piece of the e-sports pie *already* sponsor teams - the BW teams.

&gt;r/atheism is huge newlinechar  newlinechar That's really a good point, I agree - people can notice stuff which they would never start seeking by themselves. newlinechar  newlinechar The question is, what do you guys (you=American atheists/reddit atheists) have against religion? I mean, Y SO SRS? (I want to understand, not to argue) Or education/debating religion are very closely related things? In former USSR, the more educated person is the less religious he is (with rare exceptions) and nobody here have anything against religious people - it's just a sign of a very narrow life-view. I mean, if reddit was created in Russia, there for sure wouldn't be such thing as [/r/atheism](/r/atheism), at most something like [/r/DebateAnAtheist](/r/DebateAnAtheist).

The old tongue didn't really die out per se, but is only spoken by intellectuals and lords and ladies. The High Lords of Tear for instance still learn it. I would compare it to Latin in our own culture. newlinechar  newlinechar If I recall correctly from The Great Hunt Mat was speaking to the Heroes in Old Tongue. newlinechar  newlinechar I would say the less important heroes are spun out more often like Birgitte and Gaidal. Someone like Hawkwing being spun out every couple of hundred years would probably wreak havoc on the pattern. Jordan seems to indicate that they are spun out on as needed basis for whatever the pattern needs. Thus all the carefully contrived events for Rand to come about. newlinechar  newlinechar I would lean towards reality with Lews Therin and Rand. It's pretty hard to conjure accurate memories from a dead man if they aren't real.

Actually, if I recall correctly, Jeopardy! used to pay out how you described, with everyone keeping whatever they won. They changed it a while back because it was making Final Jeopardy! incredibly non-competitive - people were making incredibly conservative wagers knowing that they were going to take home their pot no matter what. The rules were changed so that only the winner got their actual score in order to make people compete for it.

Holy shit, thank you so much for posting that. I had no idea SRS even existed! I've been getting increasingly disillusioned with reddit thanks to the high douchebag-to-actual-decent-person ratio present even on the small subreddits, and I think maybe accepting that reddit's a site for douchebags and just following the most hilarious douchebaggery on SRS is the right way to go.

Your camera's white balance is probably set to 'Daylight' (or whatever your camera decides to call it), if you want to correct it be sure to set your white balance to 'tungsten' when taking shots lit by lamps/bulbs. newlinechar  newlinechar The light from the sun burns much brighter than a light bulb (obviously), this is why white balance settings exist. Fluorescent light bulbs also burn differently than tungsten bulbs (tungsten burns constantly like a candle, fluorescent bulbs burn inconsistently).  newlinechar  newlinechar This is all why different lights show up as different colours, blue/white being the hottest and yellow/red being the coolest.

This is laughable and simplistic. Many good teachers remain unemployed because we've slashed school funding to the bare bones. newlinechar  newlinechar Quality of teacher is something that schools can control to affect the quality of education, yes. But, the quality of the educational environment (class sizes are a part of this!) plays a big role too. You can have a great teacher in a room, but if they're trying to corral huge numbers of kids, they're going to be less effective.
Well, no. I'm saying it's better because what it gives us is better. I think being able to routinely cure many illnesses is better than sitting around chanting and then later dying. This shows me, at least, that it's a better method. The other method gives me nothing.
My main issue with these new Super Mash Bros. songs that have been popping up is that they've been using songs they've used in previous mashups before. SMB had already used 'Shake That' by Eminem in a previous song. I really like them, but reusing songs they've worked with isn't impressive to me.

Mass is the main part of gravity but in a way you can say density is important because it influences the possible distance from the center. To explain this say you were standing on the surface of the sun, you would still have the same amount of gravitational force pulling on you if the entire sun was shrunk to the size of a needle but retained the same mass. Though you would have a much easier time going closer to the center of gravity. newlinechar  newlinechar Edit: Because it is apparently unclear I mean if you stayed in the same location, such as if the sun was a black hole it would not affect the earth's orbit, just most likely kill everything on it due to how cold it would be. Also I admit I did forget to mention the inverse square law and gravity is inversely proportional to the distance from the center of gravity.

Not so much - people will ask me how far along I am and I will answer them and my husband is like 'no way!' it's not going to be real for him until he sees that baby bursting out of my body, until that time, he's pretty clueless, I was telling him for days before our first ultrasound that we would see the baby move around and stretch it's little legs and do pretty standard baby stuff in there, and he didn't believe me - he told me after that he wasn't expecting it to be so 'baby-ish' in there, I guess he was expecting a little potato shaped blob or something.  newlinechar  newlinechar Long story short, don't be too hard on him.

I remember reading a completely rational argument from a senator about why marijuana legalization and taxation will not result in a gain.

I don't see that as evidence of slut shaming/victim blaming, but a consequence of the fact that it's aimed at an audience (some men), who think that facts such a woman being passed out drunk and wearing a short skirt, are tantamount to mitigating circumstances - that somehow make rape not rape.  newlinechar  newlinechar By defining rape as a sexual activity defined by the absence of active consent (yes) as opposed to the absence of passive consent (she didn't say no), I think the add is spot on.  newlinechar  newlinechar 
I'm sad to say I remember this.  I also remember finding my uncle's secret stash of porn magazines whenever visiting his house.  He kept moving them around so the nephews wouldn't get into them, but we always found them.  It was like a pornographic Easter Egg hunt every time, and finally glimpsing those natural hairy vajayjays was always a glorious pay-off for my effort.  It's funny - you appreciate porn more when you have to work hard for it and you don't see it very often.

This is my biggest problem with Dany in ADWD. She definitely should not have chained the dragons and left them as a lower priority. Training them and researching ways to cultivate her relationship with them should have been her top priority, period. Those dragons are what first gave her legitimacy and potency as a ruler in many people's eyes, even perhaps more than her Targaryen blood alone. When she focused on Meereen and kind of threw up her hands with the dragons, she disappointed me quite a bit. I was very glad to see her take off with Drogon in the end, but that seemed like too little, too late.

I don't think it's fair to say the individual quality of our players is less than other seasons. Players like Vidic, Hernandez, Berbatov, Giggs (even at his age, arguably he is playing some of his best football) and Rooney are top players, and others like Nani, Valencia, Cleverly, Welbeck, Young, Carrick, the twins, Jones or Evra would make it in to almost any other team in the league except for maybe City who want and can afford a team of stars, or Chelsea (ditto). I've even left out Scholes, Park, Ferdinand and Owen based on their age and/or injury problems, but that doesn't make them bad players. newlinechar  newlinechar When you look at that list, I find it hard to justify anyone saying it's a poor team, or that the quality of players is significantly lower than any other season. The quality of their play has been questionable at times this season so I'm not saying it's been a classic United year, but they get the results.  newlinechar  newlinechar And lets not forget the start of the season where they were being hailed as a young revitalized team before injuries hit hard. newlinechar  newlinechar Speaking of, injuries are playing a huge role. We are on 3rd and 4th choices at times; Evans isn't a top player, but he does a job considering he is not first choice. Few teams can afford to have 4 top centre halves in their squad, so when two are out injured, you have to rely on guys who are good, but not good enough to want to move elsewhere. newlinechar  newlinechar I think as United fans, we have to accept that even without the Glazers debt, we do not have the sugar daddy providing us endless funds to buy a team of stars. Most of the stars are being bought up by other clubs, for huge prices, inflating the market to madness like Torres for 50 million (out of form and injury prone) and Ronaldo for 80 million. He's a top player, number 2 in the world, but if that's the bar, we have to accept United will never pay that for a player.  newlinechar  newlinechar I'll admit we only have 1 top star  - and by that I mean a player in the top 20 or 30 in the world (and Rooney absolutely is a star player, his goals aren't as important as the effect he has on the team while playing) - and to buy a second would be great; but how much would he cost? £50 million? £60? United doesn't have those funds any more seeing as there will be a wage bill to go with it.

There were some relatively minor experiences which only seem mystical in hindsight, but what I'm really talking about is this: newlinechar  newlinechar I was travelling and came down with a bad fever.  As soon as the fever set in, I began hearing this voice in the back of my head saying 'submit' over and over.  The fever got worse, and I found a bed to try to sleep it off, but the voice just got louder and more insistent.  For whatever reason, in that way that you just 'know', I knew it was God, and specifically the Christian God. newlinechar  newlinechar The Voice wouldn't let me sleep.  I wrestled and fought with it for about 16 hours while the fever kept getting worse.  Finally when I was exhausted and crying and in pain, I gave up.  I just thought 'Ok, I submit, dammit!' And the fever broke immediately, and I fell asleep. When I woke up I found a Bible under my bed.  Over the next few weeks I read it cover-to-cover, and it had an extra layer of Meaning which had never been there before. Suddenly it wasn't just a book, it was The Book. newlinechar  newlinechar The other experiences over the next months came in the form of hallucinations (visual, auditory, and somatic) all of which had a deep spiritual meaning to me. newlinechar  newlinechar Having been an Atheist all my life I naturally thought I had gone completely insane and tracked down a psychiatrist as fast as I could.  It took a while, but I finally teased out the fact that I was not losing my mind, I was still perfectly rational, but for whatever reason I was now a Christian and those insane experiences were somehow a part of that. (It has been about 5 years and I haven't had any 'crazy' symptoms since then, just in case you were wondering) newlinechar  newlinechar I hope that gives you a bit more detail.

The point is for the weapon smithing perks I thought.  Also, why comment on people discussing smithing options to tell them not to take it all?  Obviously there are different ways to play, and I was just discussing the optimal way within the play-style of using smithing.  To be honest, you can 'break' the game, take no smithing perks, make 1 really exploitative enchantment (via fortify restoration potion/fortify enchanting potion) and then use your expoitative smithing-enchanted ring to fix all your smithing problems beyond the power of the smithing tree itself.  However, this still ends in one problem that your method of 'play without smithing' has:  you can't make the armor you want, whenever you want it.   You still need armor to look good while not getting hit.

I am not a stranger to constructive criticism, and can very much appreciate any artistic insight or perspective from someone with skills, experience and tactfulness.  newlinechar  newlinechar What I don't appreciate is someone stopping by just to tell me they HATE the format of the video and the irrelevant music selection, rather than offer any criticism on the artwork itself. Then following that up by telling me I am angry at the idea that someone doesn't like my stuff, still without actually saying anything about the artwork itself. That was a little confusing.  newlinechar  newlinechar This person's comment history demonstrates consistent trolling from one art-related post to another, and very rarely feature any actual artistic advice or feedback. It is just simply a pattern of flippant negativity, with no real clear purpose other than to stir things up, offering no real benefit to anybody. This, I don't really appreciate. I am not sure how that is incoherent. Seems pretty clear to me. newlinechar  newlinechar I am new to /art, but not to the art world, and I think I should go elsewhere in the future if I am looking for artistic feedback from a community of creatives. The risk of pointless trolling is way too high, especially when it comes to self-expression. This comment thread demonstrates that.
Exactly. I don't want people coming in thinking that they'll come there to become a 'l33t h4x0r'. Thats not what a hackerspace is for.

This may sound controversial as I have no kid who was bullied, never been bullied, nor been a bully.  But I've always been one to think 'meh just let bullies be bullies and the bullied get bullied'.  It's my belief that evolution has changed around the fact that the most physically fit (read biggest asshole) succeeds, and actually made it so that the reverse case is true.  I think that being bullied teaches someone a lot of values and even skills that are amazingly valuable in today's society, whereas being an asshole physical bully does the opposite, and teaches you values that basically mean you are going to be a fuck up.  I'm probably totally wrong and may well get downvoted but it's all good. Mental bullying I feel doesn't fall under this assessment.
The slow-motion bit where the music changed, and he fires that flare, and then in big red letters you see 'MISSED,' just about killed me.
The services aren't about DRM, they are about money. Steam doesn't generally allow developers and publishers to release the details of their distribution agreements, but their take is rumored to be in excess of a third of gross revenue for any given game.  newlinechar  newlinechar Publishers are understandably not all that excited about forking over that big a share after they spend years of development time and several millions of dollars on a game, and with Steam rapidly approaching a monopoly on digital distribution, that 1/3 figure is only going to go up.  newlinechar  newlinechar From a player standpoint, I can certainly understand why people aren't excited about the new services though, as they definitely aren't developed with the best interest of the customer in mind.

I feel like this almost makes sense.  If we choose n as you do above, that implies that, regardless of the epsilon we choose, e &gt; 1/(2n+1).  Then I plug that into the initial e &lt;= 1/(2n-1) inequality to get a contradiction (although this choice of n actually doesn't work, unless I messed up.)  But I could do something like n &gt; 1/e - 5 (which I think works).  Does this sound right?

Oh my god! Resident Evil on the Gameboy Color? Capcom is really going down the drain, I can't believe they'd think a game series of this caliber can fit on a puny Nintendo handheld! newlinechar  newlinechar All sarcasm aside, it's canon, not cannon. A cannon is a strategic weapon. newlinechar  newlinechar I for one am super excited about this game. I just got into Resident Evil and have been playing through the games and I love every aspect of the environments and story/backstory, and this looks like it will let you delve deep into the background of how things worked from the other side. It's essentially similar to a bonus feature on a dvd being turned into a feature length film. Some people will just complain about everything. Just like people complaining about 4 being more than 5, yet no one noticed how much it played into the story of all the games. I nearly shit a brick when I got around to the Lost In Nightmares DLC, too. I always wondered what it would be like to traverse the mansion in a setting like 5.

That's slightly different. That community has actually done something amazing that they don't often get credit for; They've completely desensetized the word. *Everyone* on /b/ is a 'fag'. On /b/, 'fag' doesn't mean Gay or Idiot or anything else, it's just a synonym for 'Person'. They've accomplished within their community what every minority has tried to do at some point in time; they reclaimed a word of hatred.

What part of my comment made you assume I thought black people were 'a bunch of ooga booga monkey men?'  I merely said that just because a scholarship doesn't openly say this is for x race or y race, that race instantly becomes a non-issue.  Saying you are 'color blind' is just as ignorant as hating someone for their race.  Race will always be a part of our culture because it is one of our defining factors as human beings.

Her clock is ticking loudly, pretending it isn't will only make her problems worse. It's VERY easy to waste a few years on an exceptional man that is unwilling to commit, and then spend another year finding a decent guy to date...then she is 35, and in a dramaticly worse position. newlinechar  newlinechar These unrealistic Pollyanna platitudes feel good, but they're making women grow old with their cats in record numbers. If having a child and a nuclear family are important to you, and you DON'T have a devoted man thrilled at the idea by 31, you're taking a HUGE risk. 31-35 are HARD years for women, and unless you work really hard and live a very disciplined lifestyle, your looks are likely to take a severe hit, and everything you've failed to achieve already will become much much harder. newlinechar  newlinechar This is harsh, but this is the truth. That 'nice guy' that was devoted to you but you wouldn't date? That's the quality of man you're capable of inspiring family level devotion from. Guys that will have sex with you but won't even admit that you're in a relationship? That's the quality of man that is willing to have sex with you but nothing more. Don't get them confused. And don't assume that you will even have these options in a few years, because (on average), your levels for both types drop sharply in your 30s.

The reality is there is a lot of antisemitism on reddit in general. [/r/canada](/r/canada) can be bad, but to get a real dose, you've got to hang out in [/r/worldnews](/r/worldnews).  newlinechar  newlinechar In general reddit also has a hardon for Iran and arab dictatorships. The number of pro-Ghadaffi supporters in worldnews was pretty sickening. Same with pro-Assad supporters. And, of course, you'll have an article which says Israel killed a couple of Palestinian militants planting a bomb on the border wall, and it'll get 500 comments expressing the erudite opinion of 'fuck Israel,' while  an article on yet another massacre in Syria on the same day will get ignored and downvoted. newlinechar  newlinechar In regard to antisemitism itself, most posters in places like [/r/worldnews](/r/worldnews) have enough brains to hide behind anti-Israel sentiment. So whenever I wander over there, if I see anybody posting something that is outright antisemitic I tag them in RES. There's about 20-30 posters you see regularly there, that are outright antisemitic, and tend to dominate the conversation. You can learn a lot simply by following over a long period of time and taking notes. newlinechar  newlinechar And to anybody who does have honest criticism of Israel on reddit, that isn't fueled by antisemitism... we'll to you I say you need to watch your allies more carefully. To use an analogy, you're like somebody who wants to change inner city gang and thug culture, and encourage more people to go to school and succeed in life... and half of the people 'on your team' are card carrying members of the KKK. newlinechar  newlinechar I sincerely hope there aren't too many people out there who get most of their understanding of the world from this place. But the reality is it's like being stuck in a room packed with first year humanities students: they don't know much about the world, most of what they know is a gross oversimplification at best, and outright wrong at worst, but they're convinced they know everything. newlinechar  newlinechar Reddit is an utter shithole. newlinechar  newlinechar /rant off.

Thanks for the helpful response. I'll definitely go out and get a glass water bottle along with ceramic food dishes. I'll see how they use the igloos and go from there too. I plan on using fleece but I'll look into coroplast. I've looked into DIY toys for rats like toilet paper rolls stuffed with paper and maybe some treats in the center, I've also heard they like cardboard to chew up but I plan on making them a little fort to play in when I take them out of their cage. They'll probably chew the hell out of that but I have wood floors so clean up will be easy.  newlinechar  newlinechar I also thought about getting some ropes to put up in my room so they can climb and be happy! I purchased the cage with all of the toys off of craigslist for $80 and she included Harlan Teklad Lab food, it seems to be pretty good quality too.

I've looked into different bedding types but I haven't made up my mind on which one I want to use, although the one you suggested seems to be good. I'm going to try and keep the odor down because they'll be in the room I'm renting so thanks for the suggestion.

I'm really sorry for your friend, that's harsh. My thoughts are with her and you as well. I hope that you can look back on this year and know that you've survived and I'm sure she'd want you happy. Sorry to hear about your legal troubles, I hope they are resolved soon. Sorry pal -hug-!
what, role players cant use a torch?  you're making it sound like if one can't use magic, they don't have a way to light things, such as a pre-existing fire source.  granted, there are a few exceptions to reality here, but keeping a torch in your inventory to light wall torches isn't too extreme of a consideration. just don't have all of the torches already lit, we're all smart enough to pick up on the fact that if we can't see, we should look for a way to light things.  leave the cave and find that camp fire outside and cut a piece of firewood and attach some rags to it.  all of the pieces are already in the game, but for simplicity everything is already done for you.  if there was an easy 'flip a switch to make it all realistic, I'd do it, but not yet.

Well, I spent some time looking at the map.  There's some brilliant stuff here--the best use of redstone in a RFW map I've ever seen.

Will they have to resort to pillaring up and descending around to reach the wool or another pearl chest?  That could get very, very tricky.

You can't retain all those delicious IBUs without a full boil.  Wort saturates at 100 ibu - you physically can't get any more into solution.

It's not critical.

Oh, my apologies. newlinechar  newlinechar Except it doesn't actually show you it's a better method. Unless you can demonstrate that 'this works' implies 'this is true'. newlinechar  newlinechar It just shows that the method has tended to give better results this far. Assuming this is true, you have no way to advance to the conclusion you desire to make: 'observation-based modern medicine tends to give better results'. Unless you have a presupposed framework of interpretation that allows for you to make that jump.  newlinechar  newlinechar This problem was discovered by David Hume, and is called the problem of induction. Another example: there is no logical step between 'the laws of physics have worked consistently, insofar as I have observed them' and the conclusion people make, which is 'the laws of physics are always consistent and I can count on them to be the same tomorrow as they are today.' newlinechar  newlinechar Unless you have an additional, presupposed, unproven, *undemonstrable* standard by which you can measure the validity of statements, you can literally make no logical conclusions from observation. newlinechar  newlinechar My conclusion: you hold certain propositions as axiomatically true. You do this intuitively, whether you recognize it or not.

Then realize that a year is subjective to what planet you're on. A year for Jupiter is not the same as a year for us on Earth. newlinechar  newlinechar Then remember that we humans have broken down time measurements into neat little segments, i.e.: 24 hours in a day, 60 minutes in an hour, 60 seconds in a minute. Other species, developed on different planets, would have a completely different set of measurements to go by. 1 day for an alien species may be 68 quambits (made that word up) long, with 1978 upcons  (again) making up a quambit. And then an upcon may be 3.8645 seconds in length, which isn't much difference but will add up. newlinechar  newlinechar This is touched upon, albeit lightly, in the series.

How much is 'enough', though?  newlinechar  newlinechar I mean, I agree with the principle. Obviously the current pay structure for regulars is pretty bad when compared to the private sector (unless you are a scholar and end up wearing 3 stars on your shoulder).

On the other extreme, pay me $8k/mo, plus benefits, plus hazard pay, and increment my pay by $500/year - I would sign up in a heartbeat.

&gt;home birth is statistically so much safer than hospital birth newlinechar  newlinechar That claim is meaningless.

This is all true, and might I add, plugging your headphones into your stereo receiver will most likely sound really bad, those things 99% of the time have horrible headphone outputs. This is because the receiver manufacturers have been cutting corners in the headphone output quality of their products, since there's no market demand for receivers that sound anything more than 'okay' with headphones. No profit to be made from putting separate headphone audio oriented circuits inside their receivers. This leads to receivers having crappy DACs for their headphone outs, probably with output impedances way off of what your headphones would like to be paired with too. newlinechar  newlinechar There are some cases though, that will drive headphones with nice quality sound, but those are usually older receivers, like tube amp stuff from the 70's or 80's, or perhaps some vintage Fisher receivers etc. newlinechar  newlinechar You can try it out though, see how your receiver sounds, but usually it is just a lifeless, really really metallic sound, with an awful high noise floor.

No, it's really not a 'core tenant' one bit. It's something that some people think, but that many Christians disagree with.

Actually, meth has been responsible for both of my divorces. I used and sold meth for about ten years and have been clean since 7/13/01. My first wife and I were together when I was using and then still together after I got clean, but the love had died on her part due to actions while I was still using. I was abusive (physically, mentally, and emotionally), paranoid, and having auditory and visual hallucinations the last year I was using. I also raped her once and on a separate occasion put a gun in her stomach in a shitty motel room after I lost our apartment by forgetting to pay the rent and ordering her to get in the car. I was not a good man. My second wife I got married to when we both had roughly three years clean. Six months after marrying she started using meth again. I did everything within my power to help her and secure her placement in rehab, but as we (should) all know, you can't help someone who won't help themselves. I haven't seen her in several years.
Hold on a second here, I delivered pizzas for *way to long* and this never pissed me off. All it meant to me was free food. It was a boon. A perk of the job. You are being way to hard on yourself. Hell, a pizza is two meals at least. That is like a $10 tip.

Piracy is theft. You are wrong. Its as simple as 2+1=4. its just complete and utter bull. You can spin it and reason it and do what ever you would like to it in any way shape or form but it is absolutely, in the strictest sense of the word, theft. this is a **fact**. Gerstmann is too stupid to appreciate the necessary legal theory behind it and it seems you fail to grasp the same core concepts. To further debase your statement 1.) Its not the same as cassettes or video camera because it is an identical copy and 2.) video recording a movie is also illegal and punishable by federal law. If some poor criminal decides to go to a car dealership and steal a car, sure its not a lost sale because he would never have enough money to buy the car in the first place, but it is still theft. Gerstmann thinks like a child, a spoiled ignorant child with no real appreciation for the actual situation at hand with all of its complex implications and its necessary legal ramifications. There is a reason why he is in the employ of a humble gaming blog as a writer, because he doesn't really get it.  newlinechar  newlinechar And to follow up your retort that because digital code has no material worth it is not the same as stealing something like a car I pose a question to you, what if I went into best buy and stole every single playstation 3 game they had. Would you seriously argue that I should only be charged with the theft of several hundred blank blue ray discs (what a deal, 200 blank BRDs for about 200 bucks)? Or does that data actually cary a very tangible value that is rightfully restricted to those who purchased it (thus maintaining a system where by people pay for the exclusive ability to have shit, which is a system which has been functioning nicely since the dawn of time). If you think that the value of the disc includes both the data on it as well as the blue ray disc, then you have concluded the taking of said item without permission is wrong on those two points and illegal. Illegally taking an item without permission = theft.

What's with the 'TW's? newlinechar  newlinechar That's a tough one for me.  On the one hand extreme emotional manipulation can definitely be rape.  On the other, I wouldn't be comfortable calling any level of emotional manipulation rape.  Because what constitutes *emotional manipulation* is a fairly subjective question. newlinechar  newlinechar That's pretty much the law as it stands now, anyway.  Guilting your partner into sex isn't necessarily rape, but berating them and abusing them can be. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;'If you loved me, you would.' newlinechar  newlinechar Yeah, that's a tough one.  To judge these I think about how they would apply to other situations.  What if a woman tries to get her boyfriend to propose by saying: '*If you loved me, you would?*'   newlinechar  newlinechar Tough one, but generally I wouldn't call emotional manipulation rape unless it was pretty severe, and erred more on the side of actual abuse, rather than just simple guilting.

That is a good point.  However, I don't think what the Fear Factor contestants do to live animals is really humane to any of the animals, even though I might condone the behavior elsewhere.

I think it's partly an emotional argument, which is why I'm having some difficulty expressing it.
Yes, and sort of. newlinechar  newlinechar Lua itself is Unicode ignorant.  Characters are represented as single bytes, and so strings as basically byte arrays.  World of Warcraft's Lua addon API follows the convention that all Lua strings coming from or going into API methods or properties are actually byte arrays representing unicode strings in UTF-8 encoding.   Which works well enough until you decide you need to count characters in a string, or split strings, or anything else of that sort.

Sigh...
&gt;Saying that science and God don't conflict is essentially a meta-God done it in my eyes. 'Science? Yeah, God did it.' newlinechar  newlinechar Well, not really.  It's more of a 'Science?  Yeah, God *created* it.'  It doesn't mean we shouldn't understand further how the universe works, but that God created the rules.  It doesn't mean we can't explore or find new rules.  After all, relativity was always true, even millions of years ago.  Our *understanding* of it just changed. newlinechar  newlinechar And, to go into your next paragraph, this also doesn't mean God's power shrinks as we understand more of how the universe works.  In actuality, it reveals just how complex his creation really *is*.  The more we understand, and the deeper it gets, the bigger God gets in my eyes. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;If anything, I could only see my perception being more clouded by thinking both science and God were just as valid. newlinechar  newlinechar So to take your Grand Canyon example, you still feel awe at seeing it right?  To me, seeing both God and science in the Grand Canyon means seeing the results of erosion.  It means understanding that God created erosion, with the intent of creating patterns in the Earth like the Grand Canyon, and the gently rolling Appalachian Mountains.  And it means believing that God set everything in motion so all of these things happened, with just the right rules to make it all work. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;This may be slightly off-topic to the post at hand but this reminds me of a talk that Neil deGrasse Tyson gave about 'Intelligent Design' (not the anti-evolution farce) a couple years ago about why science and religion don't co-exist.

[](/b36) newlinechar  newlinechar The biggest problem is that (not to sound like an elitist asshole, because I actually am an elitist asshole) people don't actually know what they want.  Novelty accounts and memeposts are easy to understand and entertain the reader without any real contemplation or thought, so they're upvoted.  Endlessly.  And since they're easier to appreciate and notice, people will upvote them and comment on them more readily than on topics which take more effort to understand. newlinechar  newlinechar Then the cruel, regressive process that is sorting comments by number of upvotes received kicks in, giving simple, trite content more exposure and chances for success than any other type of material. newlinechar  newlinechar While this slowly and steadily kills any subreddit or community that it plagues, it does so in a soft, comforting manner, and in the end most readers will gleefully welcome the vapid, meaningless posts that choke out all the insightful, meaningful ideas around them. newlinechar  newlinechar In short, the propagation of novelty accounts is the cancer that is killing r/mylittlepony. newlinechar  [](/rdawesome 'Don't take me too seriously.

We had this problem with Dakota as a puppy. It's difficult to break the habit. Especially if you have let this go on for some time already.  newlinechar  newlinechar After doing some reading the way we got her to stop was to basically send her into submissive pose every time she bit. All this means is that we would give her a stern 'NO' and roll her onto her back. You have to sort of pin the puppy down on their back. Usually after just a few second you will notice the front paws drop.  newlinechar  newlinechar This must be done quickly so that they begin to associate it with the bite. What you're basically mimicking is the pack behavior she would get from the mother or an older dog when she bit too hard. Doing this over a period of time your puppy should learn to inhibit it's bite or not bite at all.

In that case, I'd say drop $10 - $15 on a vintage Gillette travel kit off eBay. Itty Bitty Three Piece Razor in a zip pouch with a spot for your blades.  newlinechar  newlinechar In the interest of keeping this kit as small as possible, I'd say cut out the alum block, get a mini bottle of balm, and use the smallest brush you can find. newlinechar  newlinechar If you want to get even more minimal, I'd say scrap the brush and extras all together. Just get a small tube of shave cream and hand lather. It won't be luxurious or perfect, but it will keep the number of items you have to keep track of to a minimum. That's a huge benefit when you're limited on space. And with that, you can shave whether you're in civilization or just next to a stream without having to bust out a massive amount of stuff.

The ironic thing is that terrorists do what they do to mind-fuck people.

Shipping doesn't really require humidification if in an airtight container like the bags they ship in.

I guess, having used all of these programs (as well as MS Paint and LSDJ, for comparison), I found the simpler programs to be truer of the 'art' or 'composing' experience.

I am reading about marx right now, and i have read him in the past and have more than a passing interest in the soviet union and i  can say they are related in more than one way, But the most important thing that correlates them  is the authoritarianism , the stop at nothing for the cause attitude and above all the never listen to and subsequently ostracize people with  differing opinions attitude. Marx suffered no dissent and no fools (what made him a unique thinker ) but it was also his way or the high way. for examples see his reaction to moss hess,proudhon, gottschalk among others . newlinechar  newlinechar disclaimer :i am only up to his exile in England right now for the book i am reading. if i remember from a biography read  many years ago he gets worse. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar The point i will agree with you is that Marx's form of communism was meant to work on a global scale and without revolution in more than one country was never going to work. Stalin forced marxism to fit for one country and that was a problem.
at one point in my (college) life, i owned close to 1,000 AOL CDs. it doesn't sound like a lot, sure. but it was a pretty large stack. newlinechar  newlinechar my roommates and i had collected them to wallpaper the common area of our dorm (shiny side out, of course). after some quick math, we determined that 900-some was nowhere near enough, and we'd have to keep collecting. we never got around to actually doing it, because why bother with a half-assed job? problem is, we'd exhausted *every* local business of their supplies. we'd go around and ask kindly -- most had boxes they were looking to get rid of. we took quite a few from the local theater, that my friends worked at. newlinechar  newlinechar and... they just kind of sat in my closet. newlinechar  newlinechar when it came time to move out of the dorm, i looked at them, and said to myself, 'what am i going to do with all these stupid AOL CDs?' and just left them in the closet. my roommates said they'd keep trying to find more, but, uh, i guess they just sorta forgot. newlinechar  newlinechar one day, a few months after i'd left, i got the second strangest phone call from the university i've ever gotten. the head of RAs wanted to know how i'd gotten hold of nearly 1,000 AOL CDs. apparently, he was under the impression i had somehow stolen them. newlinechar  newlinechar i just kinda said, 'you're aware that they're *free*, right?' and hung up.
First off, I might sound mean in this post, but it is not anything personal. I just enjoy being right :p. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Why blame Android for other platforms' failure? newlinechar  newlinechar For the same reason you can blame Windows for the failure of the other platforms, and the near death of apple. Undercutting the price to that kind of degree tends to do that. I'm not saying they haven't made mistakes, but to deny that the Android strategy isn't anti-competitive is silly. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;there's still plenty of innovation going on with each major release, and from forks like CyanogenMod. newlinechar  newlinechar Is there anything as interesting as the cards metaphor, or the metro ui? Or hell, as interesting as the taskbar in Windows 95? With the exception of widgets (which I think are dumb as hell) the only difference that I see between Android and iOS is the standard of apps available. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Thankfully, there are some devices out there that are fully open, like the Nexus and Geeksphone lines, as well as at least one other really nifty phone that plugs into a tablet thing that I've completely forgotten the name of. newlinechar  newlinechar That's the Asus Transfomer, which kind of strikes me as silly more than anything. What benefits does this product have over a separate phone and tablet? newlinechar  newlinechar Also, the benefit of being open is small at best. This special sale is the first time the ability to install apps without a central approval system really seems to be all that better. I have my problems with the app store (providing very little promotion for the cut they take, ratings system is a free for all, very bad about enforcing copyright), but it makes it impossible to make a bad decision while using the phone.  newlinechar  newlinechar I've also never heard of geekphone (though it seems they are still on 2.2, which is a bad sign) and I've been less than impressed with the Nexus phones. They are obsoleted far too quickly for a flagship device (the Nexus S still hasn't gotten an ICS update, and probably never will), and while the Galaxy Nexus is something of a fresh start for Android, it's brand new. It's may be that this phone will get updates on time, and apps designed for it will not suck, and the hardware won't break apart (although [it's already getting burn in from the software buttons](http://i.imgur.com/hbR6j.jpg), a problem inherent to the type of screen they are using. that they didn't put two and two together and figure out a way to stop that is a bad sign). But the iPhone has been doing that since the very start. Until google and samsung show the same kind of commitment, fuck android.
I agree with you. I think Booglysnot may have linked the wrong video. That video is from December 9 and not from any real competition.

I think comparing both December 9th and January 12th videos further proves that they seem to be using some sort of macro because you see how different the shooting styles are. I don't see how he can suddenly start having a shaky hand one month later.

I'm a United Methodist, but you might try the United Church of Christ. They are liberal and progressive. But if you are looking for a denomination that acknowledges Jesus but doesn't see him as part of the Trinity, and therefore God in the flesh, you will have a difficult time finding that.

I like mine better. You make 10 cookies a year. For years your cookies sucked, then when they started to get good on average, you started reporting how many people liked them (backfill bias). Wowzors, people see that you made 8 good cookies (up from 4). You can see how common this part is when you look at financial histories. You can see a fund was created in 2002 and they only show a graph back to like 2007... Eventually, the majority of your cookies suck, and you stop reporting your success rate of good cookies (survivor bias). newlinechar  newlinechar A cookie maker that started making 10 cookies, 8 of which were good, looks pretty good to consumers. However, the reality is that, of the 100 cookies they have made so far, only 40 have been good. Generally, the 40% success rate is the rate the cook will gravitate towards after the 80% high. By the time the cookie maker has a success rate of 6 good cookies per year or something, they will stop reporting, and then advisers look at the success rate of cookie makers and they only have data for the 80-60% success rate years. By the numbers, those advisers are going to advise you buy cookies from you (hedge funds), because the rest of the cookie market has a success rate of 60%. newlinechar  newlinechar The reality is that people want a successful rate of good cookies that last for decades, not years. They don't want to buy 10 cookies their first year, when 8 are good, but over the course of the following 10 years only 40 are good... The only way you can avoid this is to either avoid cookie makers, or you change cookie makers every couple years which is probably going to bite you in the ass unless you have the time to review other cookie menus weekly.

This is nice, but it's nowhere near an alternative to Wolfram Alpha unless the most advanced thing you use Wolfram Alpha for is computing natural logarithms numerically. Basic object persistence and function/variable declaration are nice, but unless more advanced math or programming functionality is made available, this really doesn't seem to have any unique advantage or use case. It basically seems like a normal high-school level scientific calculator (although it doesn't even have all of the functions, like factorial) with some programming syntax tacked on. The problem is that adding programming syntax doesn't really add much to the kind of calculations typically done with a scientific calculator - those calculations are usually either linear in nature, meaning things that can be completed in one line of input, or, if not, aren't significantly impacted by the round-off error incurred by retyping the first few significant digits of a previous result. The calculations that are complex enough to require programming aspects probably are best-computed by actual mathematical software like Mathematica, Sage (which already does have multiple open-sourced and free web interfaces), Octave, etc.

The sitewide spam filter is largely automated, and mods' job is more to train it than anything else.   newlinechar  newlinechar But it's like training a developmentally challenged bear with hearing problems to play chess at a grandmaster level.  newlinechar  newlinechar Mods and filter don't speak the same language, and are often attempting to convey very complex rules or standards through a very simple 'yes / no' interface.   newlinechar  newlinechar Mods can remove a post, or tell the spam filter to approve a post.

So for this particular (fixed) example, I get that 1/(2n-1) &lt; e &lt;= 1/(2n - 1) which means 1/(2n-1) &lt; 1/(2n-1) (because of the strict less-than, correct?).  And that's false because 1/(2n-1) = 1/(2n-1), so we have a value of n which causes the inequality to be false.  So should I find some integer value for n? newlinechar  newlinechar Edit:  So if e = p/q where p &gt;= 0 and q &gt;=1 and they're both integers, then n &gt; q/2p + 1/2 = q/2p + p/2p = (q + p)/2p. newlinechar  newlinechar So I have n &gt; (q + p)/2p.  But q + p &gt;= (q + p)/2p. newlinechar  newlinechar So n &gt; q + p.  Thus let n = q + p + 1.  Is this correct? (or in my n &gt; 1/e + 5 case, n = q + 5p + 1, yes?) newlinechar  newlinechar Another edit:  So if you didn't give me this awesome n value, how could I find it myself?

'Cheating?'  Sounds like sour grapes to me.  But hey, that's half of what we hear on the MW3 thread. 
Let me strongly disagree about *Raiders*. The main problem of a *deus ex machina* is that it's a completely new, un-established plot element--that is, it doesn't flow from what came before. That's why it's cheapening--the plot is resolved by something completely external to the story. newlinechar  newlinechar This is completely different from what happens in *Raiders*. The ark is an element in the plot from the beginning, and it's well-known to have a mysterious power. It may not have been Indy who saved the day, but it's Belloq and the Nazis' hunger for power that lead to their deaths by leading them to meddle with forces beyond their comprehension. (To be clear, it's not divine intervention; the Ark would have killed Indy too, if he had been looking at it.) The ending of the movie flowed both from elements that had been well-established, and from character motivations, which a true *deus ex machina* lacks.

Breeding pet store Bettas is a bad idea. They aren't bred for good genetics, only for sale and often they come from places that just mass produce fish. They are also not usually good breeding age as they are already 6 months to a year old when they arrive in stores (Bettas that old usually produce deformed fry). Also keep in mind that Dragon scale Bettas are genetically prone to some serious issues (usually into adulthood) including tumors and blindness (usually from scales overlapping the eye). newlinechar  newlinechar  If you want to breed Bettas, get a pair from a reputable breeder, or through the International Betta Congress (they even have a program for people wanting to start breeding bettas where they will send you a pair for free, from an experienced show breeder).

I tried working it out through my NCO support channel, but none of them seemed to care and always shot back that it was 1SGs call.

True, the gameplay (at least battling) of XIII is way more complex than CoD, I never meant to imply that it wasn't. But I don't think that it was any more complex that previous FF games. In other FF's, you have to apply the same basic strategies (identify weakness, how much effort you need to put towards defense/curing/etc.) only you also have to actually execute these strategies, instead of just clicking 'you do it for me'. Although my favorite battle system of any FF game is XII, which is in many ways even more 'do it for me' than XIII (although XII forces you to have a much better grasp of what is happening in any given battle). newlinechar  newlinechar I'm not sure we're still disagreeing on anything at this point (like you said, just rambling). My only complaint is when people suggest that XIII was just a little further down on the linearity scale than other FF games, where I think it is obvious that XIII is *distinctly* more linear than other games, in a way that fundamentally takes away from the experience.

Wow, slow down there buddy. Cam didn't have the greatest rookie season ever. IMHO that belongs to LT As a rookie he won defensive player of the year and basically redefined how defense was played. Other great seasons include Dickerson having 1808 yards and 18 TDs and Moss having 1313 yards and 17 TDs. Think about this, LT was not only the best LB in the league as a rookie, but the best defensive player in football. No one would rank Newton as a top 3 QB this year (Brees, Brady and Rodgers) and he would probably be ranked by most as the 6th or 7th best QB in the league right now. I hope you now take back that statement.

There are several contexts for why the one tail hasn't been seen.  From a literary perspective, Shukaku was the first beast that we saw a full transformation from.  Since then, Kishimoto has developed the formula for bijuu transformations and Shukaku doesn't quite sync up with it.  For example, Shukaku never developed a chakra cloak, or Version 2 form, so when we had Tobi signal everyone to transform into their Version 2, had Shukaku been there, it would have been six Jins in chakra cloaks... and one guy covered in sand.  It would draw questions as to why Shukaku is so different from the others at a time when it isn't relevant. newlinechar  newlinechar Another reason is, all of the Jinchuriki seen in this battle, including Naruto and Killer B, are from the most recent generation of Jinchuriki.  There have been several title pages featuring the Jinchuriki, and Gaara has always been included.  Kishimoto developed them as a 'group' and if we had some random guy show up as the 'Jinchuriki of Shukaku before Gaara' it would break that group dynamic. newlinechar  newlinechar From an in-canon perspective, the technique that Tobi is using to control the Jinchuriki is a Rinnegan technique called 'The Six Paths of Pain', which allows him to control six bodies outside his own.  That means he has six vessels, and seven beasts, with each vessel able to control one beast.  That means he has to leave one out.  There is a theory that the beasts are rated in power by how many tails they have, as first alluded by Kisame, and later stated by Kurama, although the eight tails has contested this.  Having nothing better to go on, Tobi probably used this logic in deciding which Bijuu he would leave out.
They didn't ask him that. They asked the OP.
Caliber, oh man, people go round and round about that. Ha. It's true though, there are so many opinions. The basics are as I said above. You really have to just shot a bunch and see. I thought .45 was to big for me, but after a box of ammo, it didn't seem so bad. As I got used to the recoil I could put more rounds on a target faster.  newlinechar  newlinechar I don't know if you've shot a handgun, but it's not like on TV. You see people popping off rounds like crazy with no kickback on CSI. And you can do that too IRL, but there will be a ton of kickback even from a 9mm and you better be engaging at close range or have mad skills cause your accuracy is going downhill.  newlinechar  newlinechar The basics are they either go from being a heavy bullet that goes slow, like a .45 ACP, to a small bullet that goes fast like a .357. A .357 would have a flatter trajectory and loose it's energy more slowly, so better for longer range engagements. The .45 would have the opposite characteristics.  newlinechar  newlinechar Anyway, 9mm will kick the least. I've never shot a .357, but I understand it's very much like the 9mm. That's an option, but it limits the range of guns. Glock has some .357s. Might be a slim frame model you should try. It is a more expensive ammo than 9mm. newlinechar  newlinechar Now, if you mean will it really matter in putting down an attacker? I think there are plenty of myths about crack-heads that take 4 and 5 9mm rounds to stop them. 9mm is a proven personal defense round, you shouldn't have any reservations about it. My opinion is that accuracy counts.  newlinechar  newlinechar One thing to note about 9mm is the newer +P rounds. I don't think it will be an issue with any new gun from a major manufacturer, but make sure whatever gun you get is rated for it. I think everything I looked at buying was. newlinechar  newlinechar Guns are very personal, you're just going to like what you like. Don't get too wrapped up in opinions about caliber, it'll make you nuts. Think more about the situation you are using it for: if it's concealed carry you are not getting that gun out unless the shit hit the fan, you might be panicked, and you will want to pop of rounds as quick and accurate as possible. To me that says 9mm or 40 S&amp;W.  newlinechar  newlinechar I would go for the 9mm for it's size (the gun's ultimate thickness), low cost, easy availability, and track record. Probably look for the single stack, I would check out that Walther PPS for sure. I looked at that gun. It has a removable backstrap you can replace with a smaller one. It comes in 9mm and .40 S&amp;W.

They are moving in that direction, but they haven't had the time or money until now.  This is a game company that did it the right way.  They chose to make a bundle of money first, *then* gamble on the innovation, rather than try the initial gamble with venture capital and investor money. newlinechar  newlinechar People hate them because they are successful.  Nothing more than that.  It's just reddit siding with some unknown underdog again and thinking they have some moral high ground to accompany their opinion. newlinechar  newlinechar Also: a lot of their interface coding and such is actually because of facebook requirements and standards.

We rescued a galgo from Spain (Anna at SOS Galgos) a bit over 8 years ago and they are considerably different from the retired racers.  If the galgo was primarily used for hunting, as was our Canela, you should be prepared for some challenges as they have likely never lived inside and are not as schedule-friendly as your US grey.  Their personalities are more predator, less couch potato, and can take quite a while to build trust with the bipeds since they simply haven't been handled nearly as much as a retired racer.   newlinechar  newlinechar All that said, I can't recommend a rescue galgo highly enough and our Canela got along great with our retired racer Malcolm, before he died from bone cancer a few years ago.

That isn't what entrapment is at all. First of all, entrapment can only be done by law enforcement. Second, it only applies if the law enforcement official is encouraging someone to break a law in such a way that the crime is committed but was unlikely to have occurred without the intervention of the official. Entrapment can only occur before the crime is committed. To say that Santana entrapped Sebastian is to say that she is an undercover police officer and forced him to do it even though he didn't want to. Third, the only thing this is even close to being is illegal surveillance, which also is not the case because there was no reasonable expectation of privacy to that conversation since they were in public.

The missiles aren't just attacks. Most American Christians (where I live, rural, conservative Idaho) bring up god at every possible moment. Our laws are dictated by religious morals rather than logical reasoning, and when they're not talking about Jesus, they're talking about how global warming is a myth or that Obama isn't an American citizen. In this country, Christianity tends to go hand in hand with idiocy...although I guess it's the same in most places.

Fresh mozzarella is only 70 calories an ounce. So you can eat half a lb of mozzarella for 560 calories and 48 grams of protein. That is a LOT of cheese.

&gt;What type of maintenance does an IRA require on my part? newlinechar  newlinechar Very little. If you set up automatic deposits from your checking account and automatic investment, you set it up once and won't need to think about it much. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Would it be foolish to let the bank choose the investments, or is this actually how most people handle their IRAs? newlinechar  newlinechar Wouldn't be hard to pick it yourself. I'm also 24 and am just investing in a target date retirement fund in my IRA. The things the fund managers invest in will get less risky as that date gets closer (in my case, 2050.) newlinechar  newlinechar It's very easy to 'set it and forget it' with this route. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;How likely is it that the bank loses my money/investments over the next 50 years? newlinechar  newlinechar Can't really predict that. If you make safer investments as you get closer to retirement, the risk is reduced, or you can pull out of the market completely and put your money in something that's guaranteed to not lose value if you get paranoid enough. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Should I hold off opening an IRA until I have the time to manage the investments myself? newlinechar  newlinechar Not at all, it's very easy to get started. If you decide to take a more active role later on, you can. newlinechar  newlinechar You can deposit up to $5,000 in a year into an IRA, whether Roth or traditional. $2,000 is around the mark that certain institutions require to open an IRA. newlinechar  newlinechar Personally, I'd recommend opening an IRA with Vanguard. No annual costs associated with the account. If you want to go with a target date fund, you could open one with $2,000 as the minimum to buy into those funds with Vanguard is $1,000. The minimum for additional investment in the target date funds is $100.

Oh yeah. Still dealing with it. As we speak, I'm with them in a lounge, trying to be social as we watch 'The Office' and I was reading your post and just saying 'holy shit, I didn't post this but wow, looks like my life'. It does definitely suck. But the thing is, you NEED to get yourself out there. And what I would do first is talk to the friend you're closest to. Tell him that you feel like you're bugging the crap out of him when you ask to hang out. Chances are, he'll tell you no. Ask him if, next time when he notices you haven't really been around, to come to your house and force you out. If you have a friend willing to barge in and drag you outside, you know you're set. And thats what my friends did today. So we'll see how it goes, but I'm pretty sure this means you'll be okay. Things will work themselves out. You may say I'm just being optimistic right now... and I am. But thats definitely what I need when I'm depressed, maybe it'll help you. :D

The alternative vote would be good, but I think I still prefer proportional, assuming we could somehow divide up the office of presidency. Proportional would also be great for Senate/Congress.  newlinechar Ron's views on corporate rights MIGHT work if we took away limited liability from corporations.

As is stands, they can simply calculate whether an externality risk would be worth the cost of having to pay for it monetarily. It's also of course really hard sometimes to prove in a court of law that your land has suffered environmental damage due to corporate behavior.

Um, women that might serve NS are economically productive people as well. You need teachers and healthcare workers to have a healthy, functioning economy that is prepared for any shocks the world stage may bring. Furthermore, a more disciplined workforce (and if all goes well, NS should cultivate some semblance of discipline in those who enlist) is a more productive workforce; I'm sure we can all agree that a more productive workforce is a plus to the economy. newlinechar  newlinechar Singapore is not at full employment (no economy really is). The total unemployment rate in Singapore is 2%, or ~100,000 people [Department of Statistics], so any short-term deficit in women for the first two years any such service is implemented is fairly easily made up for. In addition, Singapore's net immigration rate is also quite high, with ~25,000 fresh-of-the-boats joining our nation's workforce annually. The number of people stricken by natural unemployment *plus* the immigration rate is more than enough to account for the ~25,000 women who become NS eligible annually [CIA Factbook, yay]. As freshly ORDed women re-enter the workforce, the initial deficit in manpower is accounted for. As a relevant note, the healthcare and education sector (as well as the civil service and military sector) have just a great a need for manpower as the rest of the job market and a more comprehensive NS system can direct manpower to these sectors and serve to alleviate those needs. newlinechar  newlinechar Besides, unemployment for otherwise NS eligible women (between the ages of 15 and 24) is over 16% [CIA Factbook, double yay]. Could we expect that number to be lower if NS for women was implemented? You betcha bippy. newlinechar  newlinechar You say that social work 'will unlikely beat a free job market in terms of economic output'; I counter that the success of an economy isn't measured solely by GDP (unless you're a government statistician :P). Plus, if we relied on the free job market with the intention of maximizing economic growth the SAF would be a pretty unimpressive force of less than 40,000 soldiers when the current standby force is closer to 500,000. And don't even get me started with Civil Defence, where NSFs make up 75% of the manpower at each fire station. newlinechar  newlinechar Frankly, the economy is flexible enough to adapt to something like this and claiming that enlisting women will cause Singapore to 'fail economically' is at turns hilariously grandiose and fantastically asinine. Ultimately, I can think of quite a lot of benefits and relatively few noteworthy issues with the concept. newlinechar  newlinechar And 'economic failure' certainly isn't even remotely a valid concern. newlinechar  newlinechar Hell, I may complain about having to begin my tertiary education two years behind the majority of my peers, but NS has had a more positive impact on me than starting college with everyone else ever could. Anyone who tells you otherwise just doesn't know how to make lemonade.

Metaphysics and the likes are super cool (if thats what you were talking about). Lets say we have two people, an old one with a very small amount of 'the present' and a young one with a very large amount, which one do you kill (you have to pick one).  newlinechar  newlinechar Sure, if I have a young Adolf Hitler and a old mother Teresa, which would anyone kill? Adolf. I don't agree with 'if he's an orphan and the old man is loved in his community or something then sorry kid, but it's curtains for you.' but I could see how people could. But thats not the initial question I asked (rephrased for you in the above paragraph)
Because societies cannot coexist without people helping each other out. The middle class and poor need to pay taxes out of their disposable income exponentially more than the Rich. The poor don't even have disposable income, I'm sure there are many things they NEED that they cannot get, like college education for their children, that they may have had the chance to if not for the taxes that we all pay. So why should the rich pay the same % even though they may have so much disposable income that they cannot even spend it all even if they wanted to.  Why do so many corporations get to pay nothing in taxes, but on top of that get subsidies.  newlinechar  newlinechar Capitalism creates income inequality. Capitalism itself creates these hyper rich people. That is why we have social programs and welfare programs, to attempt to balance and offset the inherent inequality created by capitalism. This was something that less than 100 years ago, both democrats and republicans had agreed on.   newlinechar  newlinechar Socialists argue that this is band aid capitalism, it doesn't try to solve the problem, but merely deal with the symptoms.  But band aids are better than doing nothing.   newlinechar  newlinechar Republicans have the nerve to say we should have unregulated capitalism with no social programs.   They have successfully moved the goalpost to the point where that argument is legitimate, and not only that, but there are proletariat's out there, actively defending the elites.  newlinechar  newlinechar It sickens me.

Because there's something very, very wrong with the phrase 'make it fairer'. The premise of this sends chills up my spine. Let's face it, you're not asking for anyone to make anything 'more fair', are you? What the fuck does 'fair' even mean? It's a subjective term. It's a euphemism. Just say what you mean by 'make it fairer'.  newlinechar  newlinechar Life has been very 'fair' to me. I've worked my ass off for over a decade, I've lived within my means, and I've learned to support myself and never depend on a person or a system to bail me out. This is how I was raised - that society doesn't owe me shit so I'd better figure out how to make things work. Is that 'unfair'? Because I make quite a healthy living now and I certainly won't be impoverished given the next (inevitable) financial shock this country will collectively be going through.
